I s the big liner hung over the tugs swarming about her in the bay of Algiers Martin Boyne looked
down from the promenade deck on the troop of first class passengers struggling up the gangway their faces all unconsciously lifted to his inspection
Not a soul I shall want to speak to as usual Some men s luck in travelling was inconceivable They had only to get into a train or on board a boat
to run across an old friend or what was more exciting make a new one They were always finding themselves in the same compartment or in the same cabin with some wandering celebrity with the
owner of a famous house of a noted collection or of an odd and amusing personality the latter case being of course the rarest as it was the most rewarding
There was for instance Martin Boyne s own Great Uncle Edward Uncle Edward s traveladventures were famed in the family At home in America amid the solemn upholstery of his Boston house Uncle Edward was the model of complacent dullness yet whenever he got on board a steamer
or into a train or a diligence in his distant youth he was singled out by fate as the hero of some delightful encounter It would be Rachel during her ill starred tour of the States Ruskin on the lake of
Geneva the Dean of Canterbury as Uncle Edward with all the appropriate emotions was gazing on the tomb of the Black Prince or the Duke of Devonshire of his day as Uncle Edward put a courteous
but probably pointless question to the housekeeper showing him over Chatsworth And instantly he would receive a proscenium box from Rachel for her legendary first night in Boston or be entreated by
Ruskin to join him for a month in Venice or the Dean would invite him to stay at the Deanery the Duke at Chatsworth and the net result of these experiences would be that Uncle Edward if
questioned would reply with his sweet frosty smile Yes Rachel had talent but no beauty or No one could be more simple and friendly than the Duke or Ruskin really had all the appearances of a
gentleman Such were the impressions produced on Uncle Edward by his unparalleled success in the great social scenes through which for a period of over sixty years he moved with benignant blindness
Far different was the case of his great nephew No tremor of thought or emotion would in similar situations have escaped Martin Boyne he would have burst all the grapes against his palate But
though he was given to travel and though he had travelled much and his profession as a civil engineer had taken him to interesting and out of the way parts of the world and though he was always on the
alert for agreeable encounters it was never at such times that they came to him He would have loved adventure but adventure worthy of the name perpetually eluded him and when it has eluded a man
till he is over forty it is not likely to seek him out later
I believe it s something about the shape of my nose he had said to himself that very morning as he shaved in his spacious cabin on the upper deck of the big Mediterranean cruising steamer
The nose in question was undoubtedly not adventurous in shape it did not thrust itself far forward into other people s affairs and the eyes above wide apart deep set and narrowed for closer
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html observation were of a guarded twilight gray which gave the nose no encouragement whatever
Nobody worth bothering about as usual he grumbled For the day was so lovely the harbour of Algiers so glittering with light and heat his own mood so full of holiday enterprise it was his first
vacation after a good many months on a hard exhausting job that he could hardly believe he really looked to the rest of the world as he had seen himself that morning a critical cautious man of forty six
whom nobody could possibly associate with the romantic or the unexpected
Usual luck best I can hope for is to keep my cabin to myself for the rest of the cruise he pondered philosophically hugging himself at the prospect of another fortnight of sea solitude before well
before the fateful uncertainty of what awaited him just beyond the voyage
And I haven t even seen her for five years he reflected with that feeling of hollowness about the belt which prolonged apprehension gives
Passengers were still climbing the ship s side and he leaned and looked again this time with contracted eyes and a slight widening of his cautious nostrils His attention had been drawn to a young
woman a slip of a girl rather with a round flushed baby on her shoulder a baby much too heavy for her slender frame but on whose sleepy countenance her own was bent with a gaze of solicitude which
wrung a murmur of admiration from Boyne
Jove if a fellow was younger Men of forty six do not gasp as frequently at the sight of a charming face as they did at twenty but
when the sight strikes them it hits harder Boyne had not been looking for pretty faces but for interesting ones and it rather disturbed him to be put off his quest by anything so out of his present
way as excessive youth and a rather pathetic grace
Lord the child s ever so much too heavy for her Must have been married out of the nursery
damned cad not to The young face mounting toward him continued to bend over the baby the girl s frail shoulders to
droop increasingly under their burden as the congestion ahead of her forced the young lady to maintain her slanting position halfway up the liner s flank
A nurse in correct bonnet and veil touched her shoulder as if offering to relieve her but she only tightened her arm about the child Whereupon the nurse bending lifted in her own arms a carrotheaded little girl of four or five in a gaudy gipsy like frock
What another Why it s barbarous it ought to be against the law The poor little thing Here Boyne s attention was distracted by the passage of a deck steward asking where he wished his
chair placed He turned to attend to this matter and saw on the chair next to his a tag bearing the name Mrs Cliffe Wheater
Cliffe Wheater Cliffe Wheater What an absurd name and somehow he remembered to have smiled over it in the same way years before But good Lord of course How long he must have lived
out of the world on his engineering jobs first in the Argentine then in Australia and since the war in Egypt how out of step he must have become with the old social dance of New York not to situate
Cliffe Wheater at once as the big red faced Chicagoan who was at Harvard with him and who had since become one of the showiest of New York millionaires Cliffe Wheater of course the kind of
fellow who was spoken of respectfully as having interests everywhere Boyne recalled having run across Wheater interests even in the Argentine But the man himself at any rate since his marriage
was reputed to be mainly interested in Ritz Hotels and powerful motorcars Hadn t he a steam yacht too He had a wife at any rate it was all coming back to Boyne he had married it must be sixteen or
seventeen years ago that good looking Mervin girl of New York Joyce Mervin whom Boyne himself had danced and flirted with through a remote winter not long after Harvard Joyce Mervin she had
written to him to announce her engagement had enclosed a little snap shot of herself with Goodbye Martin scrawled across it Had she rather fancied Boyne Boyne wondered He had been too poor to
try to find out And now he and she were going to be deck neighbours for a fortnight on the magic seas between Algiers and Venice He remembered the face he had contemplated that morning in his
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
shaving glass and thought Very likely she hasn t changed a bit smart women last so wonderfully
but she won t know me The idea was half depressing and half reassuring After all it would enable him to take his observations and to have his deck chair moved should the result be disappointing
The ship had shaken her insect like flock of tugs and sailing boats off her quivering flanks and now the great blue level spread before her as she headed away toward the morning Boyne got a book
pulled his hat over his nose and stretched out in his deck chair awaiting Mrs Wheater
This will do yes I think this will do said a fluty immature voice a girl s voice at his elbow Boyne tilted his head back and saw a few steps off the slim girl who had carried the heavy baby up the
The girl paused glanced along the line of seats in his direction nodded to a deck steward and disappeared into the doorway of a luxe suite farther forward In the moment of her pause Boyne
caught a small pale face with anxiously wrinkled brows above brown eyes of tragic width and round red lips which at the least provocation might bubble with healthy laughter It did not occur to him
now to ask if the face were pretty or not there were too many things going on in it for that
As she entered her cabin he heard her say in her firm quick voice to some one within Nanny has Chip had his Benger Who s got the cabin with Terry
What a mother Boyne thought still wondering if it were not much too soon for that maternal frown to have shadowed her young forehead
Beg pardon sir there s a new passenger booked for your cabin The steward was passing with a couple of good looking suit cases and a bundle of rugs
Oh damn well it had to happen Boyne with a groan stood up and followed the steward Who is it do you know
Couldn t say sir Wheater Wheater s the name Well at last a coincidence Mrs Cliffe Wheater s chair was next to his own and his old Harvard
class mate was to share his cabin with him Boyne if not wholly pleased was at least faintly excited and interested by this unexpected combination of circumstances
He turned and saw a little boy standing in the door of the cabin mustering him with a dispassionate eye
All right this will do said the boy quietly He spoke in a slightly high pitched voice neither querulous nor effeminate but simply thin and a little tired like his slender person Boyne guessed him
to be about eleven years old and too tall and reasonable for his age another evidence of the physical frailty betrayed by his voice He was neatly dressed in English school boy clothes but he did not look
English he looked cosmopolitan as if he had been sharpened and worn down by contact with too many different civilizations or perhaps merely with too many different hotels
He continued to examine Boyne critically but amicably then he remarked I m in here you know You are I thought it was to be your father
Oh did you That s funny Do you know my father I used to In fact I think we were at Harvard together
Young master Wheater looked but faintly interested Would you mind telling me your name he asked as if acquitting himself of a recognized social duty
My name s Boyne Martin Boyne But it s so long since your father and I met that he wouldn t have been likely to speak of me
Mr Wheater s son reflected Well I shouldn t have been likely to be there if he did We re not so awfully much with father he added with a seeming desire for accuracy
A little girl of his own age and size but whose pale fairness had a warmer glow had advanced a step or two into the cabin and now slipped an arm through his
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html I ve been hunting for you everywhere she said Judith sent me
Well here s where I am with this gentleman The little girl lifted her deeply fringed lids and bent on Boyne the full gaze of two large and
accomplished gray eyes Then she pursed up her poppy red lips and looked at her brother For a whole fortnight Terry can you bear it
The boy flushed and pulled away his arm Shut up you ass he admonished her
Do let me ask Judith to tip the steward He swung about on her angrily Will you shut up when I tell you to This gentleman s a friend of
father s Oh the little girl murmured and then added after another fringed flash at Boyne He doesn t
look it Blanca will you please get out of here
She wavered her bright lips trembled and she turned in confusion and ran down the deck She doesn t know anything she s only my twin said Terry Wheater apologetically
He completed his scrutiny of the cabin looked a little wistfully at Boyne and then turned and sauntered away after the delinquent
Boyne returned to the deck and his book but though the latter interested him it did not prevent his keeping watch out of the tail of his eye on the empty chair which bore Mrs Wheater s name His
curiosity to see her had grown immensely since his encounter with her son and daughter in the latter of whom he discovered as the past grew clearer to him a likeness to her mother at once close and
remote Joyce Mervin yes she had had those same poppy red lips in a face of translucent pallor and that slow skilful way of man uvring her big eyes but her daughter seemed made of a finer frailer
stuff as if a good deal of Mrs Wheater s substance had been left out of her and a drop of some rarer essence added Perhaps it s because the child is only half a person there was always too much of her
mother Boyne thought remembering Joyce Mervin as being rather aimlessly abundant In such cases it s probably enough to be a twin he decided
But how puzzling it all was Terry was much less like Cliffe Wheater than his twin was like their mother There too even more so in the boy s case quality seemed to have replaced quantity Boyne
felt he hardly knew why that something obvious and almost vulgar might lurk under Blanca s fastidiousness but her brother could never be anything but distinguished What a pity such a
charming lad should look so ill
Suddenly from the forward suite the young lady with the baby emerged She had her sleepy cherub by the hand and was guiding him with motherly care along the deck She sank into the chair next to
Boyne s pulled the baby up on her knee and signalled to a steward to draw a rug over her feet Then she leaned back with a sigh of satisfaction
This is something like eh Chip she said in her gay fluty voice
Chip laughed a genial well fed laugh and fingered the brim of her hat appreciatively It was evident that the two had the very highest opinion of each other

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html I
t was none of Boyne s business to tell his new neighbour that the chair she had chosen was Mrs
Cliffe Wheater s the less so as she might he decided on closer inspection turn out to be a governess or other dependent of that lady s But no after another look she was too young for the
part even if she had looked or acted it and she didn t Her tone in addressing her invisible companions was that of command not subservience they were the nurses and governesses not she
Probably she had taken Mrs Wheater s chair because it was one of the few empty ones left and was well aware that she might presently be asked to evacuate it That was just what Boyne would have liked
to spare her he didn t see Joyce Wheater the Joyce he had known yielding her seat without a battle
I beg your pardon but in case somebody should claim this chair I might find another for you before the whole front row is taken up
The phrase sounded long and clumsy but it was out before he had time to polish it He had to hear her voice again and also to get her to turn her eyes his way She did so now with perfect composure
Evidently she was not surprised at his addressing her but only at the fact he imparted
Isn t this my chair She reached for the label and examined it Yes I thought it was Oh I m sorry
That s all right They are filling up aren t they Her brown eyes under deep lashes like Blanca s rested on him in polite acknowledgment of his
good will but he was too bewildered to see anything but a starry blur
Mrs Cliffe Wheater then this child Well after all why not His Mrs Cliffe Wheater she obviously could not be but in these days of transient partnerships there was no reason for expecting it The
Wheaters he knew must have been married nearly twenty years ago and Cliffe Wheater in the interval had made money enough to treat himself to half a dozen divorces and remarriages with all
the attendant outlay No more to him than doing over a new house good deal less than running a steam yacht Boyne half enviously reflected
Yes his neighbour was obviously a later was the latest Mrs Wheater probably two or three removes from poor Joyce Though why he should think of her as poor Joyce when in all probability
she had moved off across the matrimonial chess board at the same rate of progression as her first husband Well at any rate if this was a new Mrs Cliffe Wheater Boyne might insinuate himself into
her field of vision as an old friend of her husband s a sufficient plea he argued between passengers on a pleasure cruise Only remembering Terry s cool reception of his father s name he hesitated These
modern matrimonial tangles were full of peril to the absentee
The question was answered by the appearance of Blanca who came dancing toward them like a butterfly waltzing over a bed of thyme
As she approached the young lady at Boyne s side said severely Child Why haven t you got on your coat Go and ask Scopy for it at once The wind is cold
Blanca leaned against her with a caressing gesture All right But instead of moving she slanted her gaze again toward Boyne He says he used to know father she imparted
The young lady turned her head also and Boyne felt the mysterious weight of her eyes upon his face
How funny was her simple comment It seemed to strike all the group with equal wonder that Martin Boyne should be on speaking terms with its chief Not smart enough I suppose no Bond
Street suit cases he grumbled to himself remembering the freight of costly pigskin which had followed his neighbour up the gangway
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html The latter s attention had already turned from him Blanca I tell you to go and put on your coat
And see that Terry has his Don t lean on me like that child Can t you see that Chip s asleep She spoke a little wearily almost irritably Boyne thought but as she bent over the child her little
profile softened melting into something puerile and appealing Hush she signalled and Blanca obedient tiptoed off
Boyne at this invoking Uncle Edward patron saint of the adventurous risked a playful comment
You ve got them wonderfully well in hand She smiled Oh they re very good children all except Zinnie she screamed and Boyne
following her horrified glance saw a stark naked little figure with a shock of orange coloured hair and a string of amber beads capering toward them to the wonder and delight of the double row of
spectators in the deck chairs
In a flash the young lady was on her feet and Boyne was pressing a soap scented bundle to his breast Hold Chip she commanded Oh that little red devil She sped down the deck and catching
up the orange headed child gave her a violent shaking You ll be catching cold next you wretch she admonished her as if this were the head and front of the child s offending and having pushed the
culprit into the arms of a pursuing nurse she regained her seat
How nicely you ve held him He s still asleep She received back the hot baby all relaxed and slumber scented and the eyes she turned on Boyne were now full of a friendly intimacy and much
younger he thought than Blanca s Did you ever mind a baby before she asked
Yes but not such a good one nor so heavy She shone with pride Isn t he an armful He s nearly two pounds heavier than most children of
two When Beechy was his age she weighed only Beechy Boyne interrupted I thought you called her Zinnie
Zinnie Oh but she s not the same as Beechy She laughed with something of a child s amusement at the ignorance of the grown up Beechy s a step but you haven t seen the other steps she
reminded herself I wonder where on earth they are The steps he echoed in deeper bewilderment
Bun and Beechy They only half belong to us and so does Zinnie They re all three step children
But we re just as devoted to them as if they were altogether ours except when Bun is naughty Bun is my only naughty child oh do hold Chip again she exclaimed and once more Boyne became the
repository of that heap of rosy slumber
There s Bun now and I never trust him when he s by himself I can t she wailed as a sturdy little brown boy in a scarlet jumper came crawling down the deck on all fours emitting strange animal
barks and crowings He s going to do his menagerie tricks Oh dear And he can t with the ship rolling like this His mother was a lion tamer But he ll hurt himself I know he will oh Scopy Yes do
take him A gaunt narrow chested lady with a face hewn into lines of kindly resolution and a faded straw hat
cocked sideways on her blown gray hair had appeared in Bun s wake and set him on his feet as firmly as the rolling deck permitted His face dusky with wrath squared itself for a howl but at that moment
a very small brown girl with immense agate coloured eyes and a thicket of dark curls dashed out of a state room and hurried to him with outstretched arms Instantly the offender s wrath turned to
weeping and the two little creatures fell dramatically on each other s bosoms while the governess unmoved by this display of feeling steered them sternly back to their quarters
The young lady at Boyne s side leaned back with a laugh Isn t Scopy funny She can t bear it when Bun falls on Beechy s neck like that She calls it so foreign and unmanly And of course they are
foreign they re Italian but I m too thankful that Beechy has such an influence over Bun If it weren t for her we should have our hands full with him She hugged the sleep drunk Chip to her
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
You must have your hands rather full as it is I mean even without Bun Boyne ventured consumed by the desire to see farther into this nursery tangle and follow its various threads back to
the young creature at his side Travelling with them all like this and without Wheater to help you out he pushed on
At this she shrugged a little Oh he s not much at helping out he loathes to travel with us she said slightingly yet not unkindly Boyne was beginning to think that her detached view of human
weaknesses was perhaps the most striking thing about her
But Terry helps most wonderfully she added a smile of maternal tenderness lighting her small changeful face in which so many things were always happening that Boyne had not yet had time to
decide if it were pretty or just curiously loveable
My cabin mate Boyne smiled Yes a big boy like that must be a comfort He dared not say a big son like that for he could not believe that the girl at his side could be the mother of a tall lad of
Terry s age Yet she had distinctly not classed him among the steps In his perplexity he ventured A chap of that age is always so proud of his mother
She seemed to think that this needed consideration Well I don t know that Terry s proud of Joyce exactly but he admires her of course we all do She s so awfully handsome I don t believe even
Blanca is going to come up to her Joyce Boyne caught at the familiar name as at a lifebelt Evidently his old friend Joyce Mervin was
still situated somewhere within the Wheater labyrinth But where And who was this young thing who gave her her Christian name so easily Everything that seemed at first to enlighten him ended only by
deepening his perplexity
Do you know that Joyce as you call her used to be a great friend of mine years ago There could be no harm at least in risking that
Oh was she How jolly She says she looked exactly like Blanca then Did she Of course she s a little thick now but not nearly as much so as she imagines She does so fret about it It s her great
unhappiness Boyne laughed You mean she hasn t any worse ones
Oh no Not now They ve been on a new honeymoon since Chip haven t they old Chippo They On a new honeymoon Since Chip Then the sleeping cherub was not the property of the
girl at his side but of Joyce Mervin Joyce Wheater Joyce Somebody Oh how he longed to ask
Joyce who This last step forward seemed really to have landed him in the heart of the labyrinth the difficulty
now was to find his way out again
But the young lady s confidences seemed to invite his own Or was it just that she had the new easy way with people Very likely Still an old fogey out of the wilderness might be excused for taking it as
something more a sign of sympathy almost an invitation to meet her fresh allusions with fresh questions
Yes we were friends really great friends for a winter That s long for Joyce said his neighbour parenthetically
such good friends that I should like to tell you my name Martin Boyne and to ask what your Oh oh She shrilled it out so precipitately that it cut his last word in two At first he could not
guess the cause of this new disturbance but in a moment he discovered the young Bun walking with bare feet and a cat like agility along the backs of the outer row of deck chairs while their occupants
ducked out of his way and laughed their approval of his skill
She was also a tight rope dancer his mother was the girl flung back leaping in Bun s direction
Having caught and cuffed him and cuffed him again in answer to his furious squeals she dragged him away to the firm dishevelled lady who had previously dealt with him When she returned to her seat
pale and a little breathless she looked as if her domestic cares sometimes weighed on her too heavily
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She dropped down by Boyne with a sigh If ever you marry she enjoined him And how does she
know I never have he wondered don t you have any children that s all I say Do you wonder mother and father don t care to travel with the lot of us

he luncheon signal crashed in on this interrogation and Boyne was left alone to make what he could of it At the first sound of the gong his neighbour was on her feet hardly heeding his
suggestion that if she had not already chosen her seat they might meet at a table for two in the restaurant
Thanks a lot but of course I lunch with my children And he remembered with regret that their ocean palace had a separate dining room for youthful passengers
Dash it I should have liked a few minutes quiet talk with her Instead he drifted back to his usual place at a table of waifs and strays like himself an earnest lady
in spectacles who was preparing Sicily an elderly man who announced every morning I always say the bacon on these big liners is better than anything I can get at home and a pale clergyman whose
parishioners had sent him on a holiday tour and whose only definite idea was to refuse to visit catacombs I do so want to lead a pagan life just for once he confided to Boyne with an ascetic smile
which showed between racking coughs his worn teeth and an mic gums
Luncheon over Boyne hurried back to his corner hoping to find the seat at his side already occupied but it was empty and empty it remained as the long blue day curved down imperceptibly
Father and mother don t care to travel with the lot of us the girl had said
Father and mother That as far as Boyne could make out could mean only the Cliffe Wheaters his old original Cliffe Wheaters in their before the letter state as it were In that case the thin eager
girl at his side would be their daughter their eldest daughter born probably soon after a marriage which some thirteen or fourteen years later had produced the sturdy and abundant Chip
Very unmodern all that It gave Boyne a more encouraging view of the conjugal state than he had lately held and made him look forward with a lighter mind to meeting the lady who awaited him in the
Dolomites the lady he had not seen for five years It must certainly be pleasant to be the parent of a large reliable baby like Chip
But no sooner did he imagine that he had solved the puzzle of the Cliffe Wheaters than the image of the enigmatic trio Zinnie Bun and Beechy disarranged his neat equation The steps who on earth
were the steps and how and where did they fit into the family group which seemed with Judith hadn t they called her that at one end and Chip at the other to form its own unbroken circle Miss
Wheater he remembered had tossed him a few details about the two brown children Bun and Beechy They re foreigners Italians But if so they belonged neither to Cliffe Wheater nor to his
wife certainly not to his wife since Judith had added in speaking of Bun His mother was a liontamer not as if using the term metaphorically but as stating a plain social fact
As for Zinnie the little red devil she remained wholly unaccounted for and there was nothing in her clever impudent face with its turned up nose and freckled skin under the shock of orange hair to
suggest any blood relationship to the small Italians Zinnie appeared to be sharply and completely American as American as Beechy and Bun were Italian and much more so than the three elder
Wheaters who were all so rubbed down by cosmopolitan contacts The steps in fact had the definiteness of what the botanists call species whereas Judith Blanca and Terry were like exquisite
garden hybrids The harder Boyne stared into the problem the more obscure it became
Even the least eventful sea voyages lend themselves to favourable propinquities and in the course of the afternoon the gray haired lady whom the young Wheaters addressed as Scopy reappeared on
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html deck this time alone and seemingly in quest of a seat Boyne instantly pointed out the one next to his
and the lady saying with an austere smile I believe ours are on the other side but I can take this while Judith s resting settled herself at his side in an attitude of angular precision
As she did so she gave him a look of shy benevolence and added I understand from Judith that you re a friend of her people
Boyne eagerly acquiesced and she went on to say what a comfort it was when they were on one of these long treks with the children to come across anybody who was a friend of their parents and could
be appealed to in an emergency Not that there s any particular reason at present but it s a good deal of a responsibility for Judith to transport the whole party from Biskra to Venice and we re always
rather troubled about Terry Even after four months at Biskra he hasn t picked up as we d hoped
Always a little temperature in the evenings She sighed and turned away her sturdy weather beaten face which looked like a cliff on whose top a hermit had built a precarious refuge her hat
You re anxious about Terry He does look a little drawn Boyne hoped that if he adopted an easy old friend tone she might be lured on from one confidence to another
Anxious I don t like the word and Judith wouldn t admit it But we always have our eye on him the dear boy and our minds She sighed again and he saw that she had averted her head because her
It is as you say a tremendous responsibility for any one as young as Miss Wheater He hesitated and then added I can very nearly guess her age for I used to see a good deal of both her parents
before they were married It was a consolation to his self esteem that the lady called Scopy took this with less flippancy than
her young charges It seemed distinctly interesting to her and even reassuring that Boyne should have been a friend of the Cliffe Wheaters at any stage in their career I only wish you d gone on seeing them
since she said with another of her sighs
Oh our paths have been pretty widely divided so much so that at first I didn t know whether not till I saw Chip
Ah poor little Chipstone he s our hope our consolation She looked down and a faint brick red blush crossed her face like sunset on granite You see Terry being so delicate as twins often are Mr
Wheater was always anxious for another boy Well Chip looks like a pretty solid foundation to build one s hopes on
She smiled a little bleakly and murmured He s never given us a minute s trouble All this was deeply interesting to her hearer but it left the three steps still unaccounted for the
steps of whom Judith had said that they were as much beloved as if they had been altogether ours Not a minute s trouble I wish I could say as much of the others his neighbour went on yielding
as he had hoped she would to the rare chance of airing her grievances
The others You mean Yes those foreign children with their scenes and their screams and their play acting I shall never
get used to them never But Zinnie Zinnie s surely not foreign Boyne lured her on
Foreign to our ways certainly really more so than the two others who on the father s side She lowered her voice and cast a prudent eye about her before adding You ve heard of Zinnia Lacrosse
the film star I suppose Boyne racked his mind which was meagrely peopled with film stars and finally thought he had

PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Marrying Wheater Zinnia Lacrosse had married Cliffe Wheater But then but then who on earth
was Chipstone s mother Boyne felt like crying out Don t pile up any more puzzles Give me time give me time but his neighbour was now so far launched in the way of avowal that she went on
hardly heeding him more than if his face had been the narrow grating through which she was pouring her woes It s inconceivable but it s so Mr Wheater married Zinnia Lacrosse And Zinnie is their
child The truth is he wasn t altogether to blame I ve always stood up for Mr Wheater What with his feeling so low after Mrs Wheater left him and his wanting another boy so dreadfully with all those
millions to inherit But Boyne held up a drowning hand Mrs Wheater had left Wheater But when but how but why
He implored the merciless narrator to tell him one thing at a time only one all these sudden appearances of new people and new children were so perplexing to a man who d lived for years and
years in the wilderness
The wilderness The real wilderness is the world we live in packing up our tents every few weeks for another move And the marriages just like tents folded up and thrown away when you ve done
with them But she saw at least that to gain his sympathy she must have his understanding and after another cautious glance up and down the deck she settled down to elucidate the mystery and fill in the
gaps Of course she began Judith having told her that he Mr Boyne was the name Thanks Hers was Miss Scope Horatia Scope she knew the children called her Horror Scope behind her back but
she didn t mind well Judith having told her that Mr Boyne was a friend of her parents Miss Scope had inferred that he had kept up with the successive episodes of the couple s agitated history but now
that she saw he didn t know she would try to make it clear to him if one could use the word in speaking of such a muddled business It took a great deal of explaining as he would see but if any
one could enlighten him she could for she d come to the Wheaters as Judith s governess before Blanca and Terry were born before the first no the second serious quarrel she added as if saying Before
the Hittite invasion Quarrels it seemed there had been many since she had lost count she confessed but the bad the
fatal one had happened when Mrs Wheater had met her Prince the wicked Buondelmonte who was the father of Bun and Beechy Beatrice and Astorre Buondelmonte as the children were really named
Here Boyne submerged had to hold up his hand again But if Zinnie was Wheater s child he interrupted were Bun and Beechy Mrs Wheater s And whose in the name of pity was Chipstone
Well Miss Scope said she understood his wonder his perplexity it did him credit she declared to be too high minded to take in the whole painful truth at a glance No Bun and Beechy thank heaven
were not Mrs Wheater s children they were the offspring of the unscrupulous Prince Buondelmonte and a vile woman a circus performer she believed whom he had married and deserted before poor
Mrs Wheater became infatuated with him Infatuated was a horrid word she knew but Mrs
Wheater used it herself in speaking of that unhappy time Well Mrs Wheater in her madness had insisted on leaving her husband in order to marry Prince
Buondelmonte Mr Wheater though she had behaved so badly was very chivalrous about it and put himself in the wrong Boyne rejoiced at the phrase so that his wife might divorce him but he insisted
on his right to keep Terry with him and on an annual visit of four months from Judith and Blanca
and as there was a big fight over the alimony Mrs Wheater had to give in about the children and that was when Judith s heart break began Even as a little thing Miss Scope explained Judith couldn t
bear it when her parents quarrelled She had had to get used to that alas but what she couldn t get used to was after the divorce and the two remarriages being separated from Terry and bundled up
every year with Blanca and sent from pillar to post first to one Palace Hotel and then to another wherever one parent or the other happened to be It was that Miss Scope thought which had given
the grown up look to her eyes
Luckily Mrs Wheater s delusion didn t last long the Prince hadn t let it Before they d been married a year he d taken care to show her what he was Poor Judith who was alone with her mother during
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html the last dreadful months knew something of that But Miss Scope realised that she mustn t digress
but just stick to the outline of her story till it became a little clearer to Mr Boyne
Well when Mrs Wheater s eyes were opened and the final separation from the Prince took place she Mrs Wheater was so sorry for Beatrice and Astorre there was really nobody kinder than Mrs
Wheater that she kept the poor little things with her and had gone on keeping them ever since Their father had of course been only too thankful to have them taken off his hands and their miserable
mother too Here Miss Scope paused for breath and hoped that Mr Boyne was beginning to grasp Yes beginning but Chipstone he patiently insisted
Oh Chip dear Chip s a Wheater all right The very image of his father don t you think But I see that I haven t yet given you all the threads there are so many Where was I Oh about Mrs
Wheater s separation You know there s no divorce in Italy and she thought she was tied to the Prince for life But luckily her lawyers found out that he had been legally married in some Italian consulate
at the other end of the world to the mother of Bun and Beechy and as the woman was still alive the Prince s marriage with Mrs Wheater had been bigamous and was immediately annulled and she
became Mrs Wheater again And then
Then she was dreadfully miserable about it all and Mr Wheater was miserable too because in the meanwhile he d found out about the horror he d married and was already suing for a divorce And
Judith who was thirteen by that time and as wise and grown up as she is now begged and entreated her father and mother to meet and talk things over and see if they couldn t come together again so
that the children would never have to be separated and sent backward and forward like bundles She did that That child
Judith s never been a child there was no time So she got Mr and Mrs Wheater together and they were both sore and unhappy over their blunders and realised what a mess they d made and finally
they decided to try again and they were remarried about three years ago and then Chip was born and of course that has made everything all right again for the present
The present Boyne gasped and the governess smoothed back her blown hair and turned the worn integrity of her face on his
If I respect the truth how can I say more than the present But really I put it that way only for fear for fear of the Fates overhearing me Everything s going as smoothly as can be and we should
all be perfectly happy if it weren t for poor Terry whose health never seems to be what it should Mr
and Mrs Wheater adore Chip and are very fond of the other children and Judith is almost sure it will last this time
Miss Scope broke off and looked away again from Boyne Her almost wrung his heart and he wanted to put his hand out and clasp the large gray cotton glove clenched on her knee But instead he
only said If anything can make it last you and Judith will and the governess answered Oh it s all Judith And she has all the children behind her They say they refuse to be separated again Even the
little ones say so They re much more attached to each other than you d think to hear them bickering and wrangling And they all worship Judith Even the two foreigners do

he children at first had been unanimously and immovably opposed to going to Monreale
Long before the steamer headed for Palermo the question was debated by them with a searching thoroughness Judith who had never been to Sicily had consulted Boyne as to the most profitable way
of employing the one day allotted to them and after inclining to Segesta Boyne on finding that everybody including Chip was to be of the party suggested Monreale as more accessible
And awfully beautiful too Judith was looking at him with hungry ignorant eyes
One of the most beautiful things in the world The mosaics alone She clasped ecstatic hands We must go there I ve seen so little
Why I thought you d travelled from one end of Europe to the other That doesn t show you anything but sleeping cars and Palace Hotels does it Mother and father
never even have a guide book they just ask the hall porter where to go And then something always seems to prevent their going You must show me everything everything
Well we ll begin with Monreale But the children took a different view Miss Scope unluckily had found an old Baedeker on the
steamer and refreshing her mind with hazy reminiscences gleaned from former pupils had rediscovered the name of a wonderful ducal garden containing ever so many acres of orange trees
always full of flowers and fruit Her old pupils had gone there she recalled and been allowed by the gardeners to pick up from the ground as many oranges as they could carry away
At this the children a close self governing body instantly voted as one man for the Giardino Aumale Boyne had already observed that in spite of Judith s strong influence there were moments
when she became helpless against their serried opposition and in the present case argument and persuasion entirely failed At length Terry evidently wishing as the man of the party to set the
example of reasonableness remarked that Judith who had all the bother of looking after them ought to go wherever she chose Bun hereupon squared his mouth for a howl and Blanca observed tartly that
by always pretending to give up you generally got what you wanted Well you d better try then Terry retorted severely and the blood rose under his sister s delicate skin as if he had struck her
Terry What a beast you are I didn t mean Meanwhile Beechy melting into tears at the sight of Bun s distress was hugging his tumbled head
against her breast with murmurs of Zitto zitto carissimo Cuor mio and glaring angrily at Judith and Terry
Well I want to go where there s zoranges to eat said Zinnie in her sharp metallic American voice with which she might almost have peeled the fruit r if I don t I want something a lot better nstead
n I mean to have it Boyne laughed and Judith murmured despairingly We d better go to their orange garden
Look here Terry interposed the little ones are mad to hear the end of that story of the old old times about the two children who d never seen a motor They re all so fed up with airships and
machinery and X rays and wireless and you know you promised to go on with that story some day
Why couldn t we go to the place you want to see and you ll promise and swear to finish the story there and to have chocolates for tea
Oh and oranges I ll supply the oranges Boyne interposed There s a jolly garden next to the cloister and I ll persuade the guardian to let us in and we ll have a picnic tea there
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html An masses of zoranges Zinnie stipulated with a calculating air while Beechy surreptitiously dried
Bun s tears on her crumpled pinafore and Bun heartlessly forsaking her to turn handsprings on the deck shrieked out Noranges Noranges NORANGES
Oh very well I knew Blanca murmured shooting her gray glance toward Boyne and Judith lifting up Chip triumphantly declared He says he wants to go to Monreale
That settles it of course said Blanca with resigned eyelids
A wordy wrangle having arisen between Zinnie Beechy and Bun as to whether the fruit for which they clamoured should be called zoranges or noranges Judith and Miss Scope took advantage of the
diversion to settle the details of the expedition with Boyne and the next morning when the steamer lay to off Palermo the little party equipped and eager headed the line of passengers for the tug
Boyne stretched out at length on a stone bench in the sun lay listening with half closed eyes to Judith s eager plaintive voice He had bribed the custodian to let them pass out of the cloister into the
lavender scented cathedral garden drowsing on its warm terrace above the orange orchards Far off across the plain the mountains descended in faint sapphire gradations to the denser sapphire of the
sea along which the domed and towered city gleamed uncertainly And here close by sat Judith Wheater in the sun the children heaped at her knee and Scopy and Nanny at a discreet distance
knitting and nursing the tea basket Judith s voice went on But when Polycarp and Lullaby drove home in the victoria with the white horse to their mamma s palace they found that the zebra door mat
had got up and was eating all the flowers in the drawing room vases and the big yellow birds on the wall paper were all flying about and making the most dreadful mess scattering seeds about the rooms
But the most wonderful thing was that the cuckoo from the nursery clock was gone too so that the nurses couldn t tell what time it was and when the children ought to be put to bed and to get up
again Oh how perfectly lovely chanted Bun and Beechy chorused Lovelly lovelly
Not at all said Judith severely It was the worst thing that had happened to them yet for the cook didn t know what time it was either and nobody in the house could tell her so there was no breakfast
ready and the cook just went off for a ride on the zebra because she had no carriage of her own and she said there was nothing else to do
Why didn t they tell their father n mother Zinnie queried in a practical tone
Because they d got new ones who didn t know about the cuckoo either I guess said Bun with authority
Then why didn t the children go with their old fathers an mothers Zinnie inserted
Because their old mother s friend Sally Money wasn t big enough big enough big enough
for her to take them all with her Bun broke off visibly puzzled as to what was likely to follow
Big enough to take them all on her back and carry them away with her But I daresay the new father and mother would have been all right Judith pursued if only the children had been patient and
known how to treat them only just at first they didn t and besides at the time I am telling you about they happened to be away travelling
Then why didn t the children telephone to them to come back Because there weren t any telephones in those days
No telephones Does it say so in the hist ry books snapped Zinnie sceptical
Course it does you silly Why when Scopy was little Terry reminded them she lived in a house where there wasn t any telephone
Beechy ever tender hearted immediately prepared to cry at the thought of Scopy s privation but Scopy interpolated severely Now Beatrice don t be foreign and the story teller went on So there
was no way whatever for them to get any breakfast and
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Oh I know I know They starved to death poverini Beechy lamented promptly transferring her
grief to another object and flinging her little brown arms heavenward in an agony of participation
Not just yet For they met on the edge of the wood What wood There wasn t any wood before said Zinnie sharply
No but there was one now for all the trees and flowers from the wall papers had come off the wall and gone out into the garden to grow so that the big yellow birds should have a wood to build their
nests in and the zebras should Zebras There was only one zebra This sardonically from a grown up looking indifferent Blanca
Stupid He d been married already and had a lot of perfectly lovely norphans and three dear little steps like us and Mrs Zebra she had a big family too no she had two big families Zinnie announced
enumerating the successive groups on her small dimpled fingers
Oh how lovely for the zebra Then all the little zebras stayed together always afterward f rever and ever Say they did oh Judith say it Beechy clamoured
Of course they did Zinnie you mustn t call Blanca stupid But all this time Polycarp and Lullaby were starving because the clock had stopped and the cook had gone out on the zebra
And they were starving slowly starving to death Zinnie gloated
Yes but on the edge of the wood whom did they meet but a great big tall gentleman with a mot no I mean a pony carriage
What s a pony A little horse about as big as Bun
Oh oh I m a pony shouted Bun kicking and neighing And the pony carriage was full absolutely brim full of what do you think Judith concluded her
question drowned in a general cry of Oranges No noranges zoranges from the leaping scrambling group before whom at the dramatic moment Boyne had obligingly uncorded his golden
bales while Miss Scope and Nanny murmured Now children children now And this is our chance said Boyne to make a dash for the cathedral
He slipped his hand through Judith s arm and drew her across the cloister and into the great echoing basilica At first after their long session on the sun drenched terrace the place seemed veiled
in an impenetrable twilight But gradually the tremendous walls and spandrils began to glow with their own supernatural radiance the solid sunlight of gold and umber and flame coloured mosaics against
which figures of saints prophets kings and sages stood out in pale solemn hues Boyne led the girl toward one of the shafts of the nave and they sat down on its projecting base
Now from here you can see But he presently perceived that she could see nothing Her little profile was studiously addressed to
the direction in which he pointed and her head thrown back so that her lips were parted and her long lashes drew an upward curve against her pale skin but nothing was happening in the face which was
usually the theatre of such varied emotions
She sat thus for a long time and he did not move or speak again Finally she turned to him and said in a shy voice it was the first time he had noticed any shyness in her I suppose I m much more
ignorant than you could possibly have imagined You mean that you don t particularly care for all this
She lowered her voice to answer I believe all those big people up there frighten me a little And she added I m glad I didn t bring Chip
Child He let his hand fall on hers with a faint laugh What a child she became as soon as she was away from the other children

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html But I do want to admire it you know she went on earnestly because you do and Scopy says you
know such a lot about everything It s not a question of knowing he began and then broke off For wasn t it after all exactly that
How many thousand threads of association strung with stored images of the eye and brain memories of books of pictures of great names and deeds ran between him and those superhuman images
tracing a way from his world to theirs Yes it had been stupid of him to expect that a child of fifteen or sixteen brought up in complete ignorance of the past and with no more comprehension than a savage
of the subtle and allusive symbolism of art should feel anything in Monreale but the oppression of its awful unreality And yet he was disappointed for he was already busy at the masculine task of
endowing the woman of the moment with every quality which made life interesting to himself
Woman but she s not a woman She s a child His thinking of her as anything else was the crowning absurdity of the whole business Obscurely irritated with himself and her he stood up
turning his back impatiently on the golden abyss of the apse Come along it s chilly here after our sun bath Gardens are best after all
In the doorway she paused a moment and sent her gaze a little wistfully down the mighty perspective they were leaving Some day I know I shall want to come back here she said
Oh well we ll come back together he replied perfunctorily
But outside in the sunlight with the children leaping about her and guiding her with joyful cries toward the outspread tea things she was instantly woman again gay competent composed and
wholly mistress of the situation
Yes decidedly the more Boyne saw of her the more she perplexed him the more difficult he found it to situate her in time and space He did not even know how old she was somewhere between fifteen
and seventeen he conjectured nor had he as yet made up his mind if she were pretty In the cathedral just now he had thought her almost plain with the dull droop of her mouth her pale
complexion which looked dead when unlit by gaiety her thick brown hair just thick and just brown without the magic which makes some women s hair as alive as their lips and her small impersonal
nose a nose neither perfectly drawn like Blanca s nor impudently droll like Zinnie s The act of thus cataloguing her seemed to reduce her to a bundle of negatives yet here in the sunshine her hat thrown
off her rumpled hair and all the children scrambling over her her mouth became a flame her eyes fountains of laughter her thin frail body a quiver of light he didn t know how else to put it Whatever
she was she was only intermittently as if her body were the mere vehicle of her moods the projection of successive fears hopes ardours with hardly any material identity of its own Strange he mused
that such an imponderable and elusive creature should be the offspring of the two solid facts he recalled the Cliffe Wheaters as being For a reminder of Joyce Mervin as he had known her tall
vigorous and substantial one must turn to Blanca not Judith If Blanca had not had to spare a part of herself for the making of Terry she would have been the reproduction of her mother But Judith was
like a thought a vision an aspiration all attributes to which Mrs Cliffe Wheater could never have laid claim And Boyne when the tired and sleepy party were piled once more into the motor had not yet
decided what Judith looked like and still less if he really thought her pretty
He fell asleep that night composing a letter to the lady in the Dolomites what you would think A strange little creature who changes every hour hardly seems to have any personality of her own except
when she s mothering her flock Then she s extraordinary playmate mother and governess all in one
and the best of each in its way As for her very self when she s not with them you grope for her identity and find an instrument the wind plays on a looking glass that reflects the clouds a queer little
sensitive plate very little and very sensitive and with a last flash of caution just as sleep overcame him he added Unluckily not in the least pretty

One of Rose Sellars s jolly letters clever understanding and humorous Why did Boyne feel a sudden flatness in it Something just a trifle mincing self conscious prepared Yes if Mrs Sellars
excelled in one special art it was undoubtedly that of preparation She led up to things the simplest things with the skill of a clever rider putting a horse at a five barred gate All her life had been a series
of adaptations arrangements shifting of lights lowering of veils pulling about of screens and curtains No one could arrange a room half so well and she had arranged herself and her life just as
skilfully The material she had had to deal with was poor enough in every way unworthy of her but as her clever hands could twist a scarf into a divan cover and ruffle a bit of paper into a lamp shade so
she had managed out of mediocre means a mediocre husband an ugly New York house and a dull New York set to make something distinguished personal almost exciting so that in her little world
people were accustomed to say Rose Sellars as a synonym for cleverness and originality
Yes she had had the art to do that and to do it quietly unobtrusively by a touch here a hint there without ever reaching out beyond her domestic and social frame work Her originality in the present
day lay in this consistency and continuity It was what had drawn Boyne to her in the days of his big wanderings when returning from an arduous engineering job in Rumania or Brazil or Australia he
would find in his ever shifting New York the one fixed pole of Mrs Sellars s front door always the same front door at the same number of the same street with the same Whistler etchings and Sargent
water colours on the drawing room walls and the same quiet welcome to the same fireside
In his homeless years that sense of her stability had appealed to him peculiarly the way each time he returned she had simply added a little more to herself like a rose unfurling another petal A rose in
full sun would have burst into quicker bloom it was part of Mrs Sellars s case that she had always as Heine put it been like a canary in a window facing north Not due north however but a few points
north by west so that she caught not the sun s first glow but its rich decline He could never think of her as having been really young immaturely young like this girl about whom they were exchanging
humorous letters and who in certain other ways had a precocity of experience so far beyond Mrs
Sellars s But the question of a woman s age was almost always beside the point When a man loved a woman she was always the age he wanted her to be when he had ceased to she was either too old for
witchery or too young for technique And five years is too long a time he summed it up again with a faint return of the apprehension he always felt when he thought of his next meeting with Mrs Sellars
Five years was too long and these five in particular had transformed the situation and perhaps its heroine It was a new Rose Sellars whom he was to meet When they had parted she was still a wife
resigned exemplary and faithful in spite of his pleadings now she was a widow The word was full of disturbing implications and Boyne had already begun to wonder how much of her attraction had been
due to the fact that she was unattainable It was all very well to say that he wasn t that kind of man the kind to tire of a woman as soon as she could be had That was all just words in matters of sex and
sentiment as he knew a man was a different kind of man in every case that presented itself Only by

going to the Dolomites to see her could he really discover what it was that he had found so haunting in Rose Sellars So he was going
Mr Boyne could we have a quiet talk do you think Boyne driven from the deck by the heat and glare and the activities of the other passengers was
lying on his bed book in hand in a state of after luncheon apathy His small visitor leaned in the doorway slender and gray clad Terry Wheater with the faint pinkness on his cheek bones the
brilliance in his long lashed eyes that made his honest boy s face at times so painfully beautiful
Why of course old man Come in You ll be better off here than on deck till it gets cooler Terry tossed aside his cap and dropped into the chair at Boyne s bedside They had shared a cabin
for nearly a fortnight and reached the state of intimacy induced by such nearness when it does not result in hate but Boyne had had very few chances to talk with the boy Terry was always asleep when
the older man turned in and Boyne himself was up and out long before Terry kept in bed by the vigilant Miss Scope had begun his leisurely toilet Boyne by now had formed a fairly clear idea of the
characteristics of the various young Wheaters but Terry was perhaps the one with whom he had spent the least time and the boy s rather solemn tone and grown up phraseology made him lay aside his
book with a touch of curiosity
What can I do for you Terry Persuade them that I ought to have a tutor
Them I mean the Wheaters father and mother Terry corrected himself The children Boyne knew
frequently referred to their parents by their surname The habit of doing so Miss Scope had explained rose from the fact that in the case of most of the playmates of their wandering life the names father
and mother had to be applied successively or simultaneously to so many different persons indeed one surprising little girl with black curls and large pearl earrings whom they had met the year before
at Biarritz had the habit of handing to each new playmate a typed table of her parents various marriages and her own successive adoptions So they all do it now that is speak of their different sets
of parents by their names And my children have picked up the habit from the others though in their own case luckily it s no longer necessary now that their papa and mamma have come together again
I mean father and mother Terry repeated Make them understand that I must be educated
There s no time to lose And you could His eyes were fixed feverishly alas too feverishly on Boyne s and his face had the air of precocious anxiety which sometimes made Judith look so
My dear chap of course I ll do anything I can for you But I don t believe I shall be seeing your people this time I m going to jump into the train the minute we get to Venice
The boy s face fell You are I m sorry And Judy will be awfully sold That s very good of her and of you But you see
Oh I can see that a solid fortnight of the lot of us is a good deal for anybody Terry acquiesced All the same Judy and I did hope you d stay in Venice for a day or two We thought you see there were a
good many things you could do for us Boyne continued to consider him thoughtfully I should be very glad if I could But I m afraid you
overrate my influence I haven t seen your parents for years They d hardly remember me That s just it you d be a novelty said Terry astutely
Well if that s an inducement Anyhow you may be sure I ll do what I can if I find I can alter my plans
Oh if you could You see I ve really never had anybody to speak for me Scopy cuts no ice with them and of course they think Judy s too young to know about education specially as she s never had
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html any herself She can t even spell you know She writes stomach with a k And they ve let me go on like
this just with nurses and nursery governesses that s really all Scopy is as if I wasn t any older than Bun when I m at an age when most fellows are leaving their preparatory schools The boy s face
coloured with the passion of his appeal and the flush remained in two sharp patches on his cheeks
Of course he went on Judy says I m not fair to them that I don t remember what a lot they ve had to spend for me on doctors and climate and all that And they did send me to school once and I
had to be taken away because of my beastly temperature I know all that But it was a sell when I left school just to come back again to Scopy and Nanny and nobody a fellow could put a question to or
get a tip from about what other fellows are learning Last summer at St Moritz I met a boy not much older than I am who was rather delicate too and he d just got a new father who was a great reader and
who had helped him no end and got a tutor for him and he d started C sar and was getting up his Greek verbs with a temperature every evening too And I said to Judy Now look at that And she
said yes it would be splendid for me to have a tutor And for two weeks the other fellow s father let me work a little with him But then we had to go away one of our troubles Terry interrupted himself is
that we re so everlastingly going away But I suppose it s always so with children isn t it with all the different parents they re divided up among and all the parents living in different places and fighting
so about when the children are to go to which and the lawyers always changing things just as you think they re arranged Of course a chap must expect to be moving about when he s young But Scopy
says that later parents settle down He added this on a note of interrogation and Boyne feeling that an answer was expected declared with conviction Oh but they do by Jove they do
Inwardly he was recalling the warm cocoon of habit in which his own nursery and school years had been enveloped giving time for a screen of familiar scenes and faces to form itself about him before he
was thrust upon the world What had struck Boyne first about the little tribe generically known as the Wheaters was that they were so exposed so bared to the blast as if they had missed some stage of
hidden growth for which Palace Hotels and Riviera Expresses afforded no sufficient shelter He found his gaze unable to bear the too eager questioning of the boy s and understood why Miss Scope looked
away when she talked of Terry
Settle down Rather People naturally tend to as they get older Aren t your own parents proving it already Haven t you all got together again so to speak Boyne winced at his own exaggerated tone of
optimism It was a delicate matter in such cases to catch exactly the right note
Yes Terry assented You d think so But I know children who ve thought so too and been jolly well sold The trouble is you can never be sure when parents will really begin to feel old Especially
with all these new ways the doctors have of making them young again But anyhow he went on more hopefully if you would put in a word I m sure it would count a lot And Judy is sure it would too
Then of course I will I ll stop over a day or two and do all I can Boyne assured him casting plans and dates to the winds
He was not certain that the appeal had not anticipated a secret yearning of his own a yearning not so much to postpone his arrival at Cortina to that he would not confess as to defer the parting from
his new friends and especially from Judith The Monreale picnic had been successfully repeated in several other scenes of classic association and during the gay and clamorous expeditions ashore and
the long blue days on deck he had been gradually penetrated by the warm animal life which proceeds from a troop of happy healthy children Everything about the little Wheaters and their steps excited
his interest and sympathy and not least the frailness of the tie uniting them and their determination that it should not be broken There was something tragic to Boyne in the mere fact of this
determination it implied a range of experience and a power of forethought so far beyond a child s natural imagining To the ordinary child Boyne s memories told him separation means something too
vague to fret about beforehand and too pleasantly tempered when it comes by the excitement of novelty and the joy of release from routine to be anything but a jolly adventure Boyne could not
recall that he had ever minded being sent from home to the seashore to a summer camp or to an aunt s when a new baby was expected as long as he was allowed to take his mechanical toys with him
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Any place that had a floor on which you could build cranes and bridges and railways was all right if there was a beach with sand that could be trenched and tunnelled and water that could be dammed
then it was heaven even if the porridge wasn t as good as it was at home and there was no mother to read stories aloud after supper
He could only conjecture that what he called change would have seemed permanence to the little Wheaters and that what change signified to them was something as radical and soul destroying as it
would have been to Boyne to see his mechanical toys smashed or his white mice left to die of hunger
That it should imply a lasting separation from the warm cluster of people pets and things called home would have been no more thinkable to the infant Boyne than permanence was to the infant Wheaters
Judith had explained that almost all their little friends usually acquaintances made in the world of Palace Hotels were in the same case as themselves As Terry had put it when you were young you
couldn t expect not to move about and when Judith proceeded to give Boyne some of the reasons which had leagued her little tribe against the recurrence of such moves he had the sick feeling with
which a powerless looker on sees the torture of an animal The case of poor Doll Westway for instance who was barely a year older than Judith and whom they had played with for a summer at
Deauville and now
Well it was all a damned rotten business that was what it was And Judith s resolve that her children should never again be exposed to these hazards thrilled Boyne like the gesture of a Joan of
Arc As the character of each became more definite to him as he measured the distance between Blanca s cool self absorption tempered only by a nervous craving for her twin brother s approval and
the prodigal self abandonment of Beechy as he compared the detached and downright Zinnie to the sinuous and selfish Bun and watched the interplay of all these youthful characters he marvelled that
the bond of Judith Wheater s love for them should be stronger than the sum of such heredities But so it was He had seen how they could hang together against their sister when some childish whim united
them and now he could imagine what an impenetrable front they would present under her leadership
Of course the Cliffe Wheaters would stay together if their children were determined that they should
and of course they would give Terry a tutor if he wanted one How was it possible for any one to look at Terry and not give him what he wanted Boyne wondered At any rate he Boyne meant to accompany
the party to Venice and see the meeting Incidentally he was beginning to be curious about seeing the Wheaters themselves
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
here was no doubt about the Wheaters welcome When Boyne entered the big hall of their hotel on the Grand Canal he instantly recognized Cliffe Wheater in the florid figure which seemed to fill the
half empty resonant place with its own exuberance Cliffe Wheater had been just like that at Harvard
The only difference was that he and his cigar had both grown bigger And he seemed to have as little difficulty in identifying Boyne
Hullo he shouted so that the hall rocked with his greeting and the extremely slim young lady in a Quaker gray frock and endless pearls to whom he was talking turned her head toward the newcomer
with a little pout of disdain The pout lingered as her eyes rested on Boyne but he perceived that it was not personally addressed to him She had a smooth egg shaped face as sweetly vacuous as that of the
wooden bust on which Boyne s grandmother s caps used to be done up with carmine lips of the same glossy texture and blue gray eyes with long lashes that curved backward like the bust s as though
they were painted on her lids and Boyne had the impression that her extreme repose of manner was due to the fear of disturbing this facial harmony
Why Martin dear she presently breathed in a low level voice putting out a hand heavy with rings
and Boyne understood that he was in the presence of the once redundant Joyce Wheater and that in her new fashion she was as glad to see him as ever
I ve grown so old that you didn t recognise me but I should have known you anywhere she reproached him in the same smooth silvery voice
Old you he found himself stammering but the insipidities she evidently awaited were interrupted by her husband
Know him I should say so Not an ounce more flesh on him than there used to be after all these years how d yer do it I wonder Great old times we used to have in the groves of John Harvard eh

he has you just feel this calf of his Hard as a tennis ball it is Does you no end of credit Judy
Here pass him on to the room next to your mother s Wish you d develop that kind of calf Terry boy
Look at my calfs too I can show them upside down shouted Bun bursting in with a handspring upon these endearments while Blanca wide eyed and silent fastened her absorbed gaze on the
golden thatch of her mother s intricately rippled head and Joyce clasped the children one after another to her pearls
Give Terry a tutor Boy s own idea was it Good old chap always poking around with books
Wheater would have thought that Terry knew enough to be his own tutor by this time Funny wasn t

it for a son of his Cut out to be a Doctor of Divinity or President of a University maybe Talk of heredity for him and Joyce to have turned out such a phenomenon Hoped Chipstone wouldn t turn
into a Doctor of Divinity too But of course they d give Terry a tutor wouldn t they Joyce The boy was dead right he couldn t be loafing about any longer with the women Did Boyne happen to know
of a tutor by any chance Wheater d never before had anything of the sort to bother about Right up on schools of course always meant to send Terry to Groton but his rotten temperature had knocked
that out so now
The three were sitting after dinner on the balcony of the Wheaters apartment watching the Grand Canal gondola laden lamp flecked furrowed with darting motor boats drift beneath them in rich
coils and glassy volutes There was nothing doing in Venice Wheater had explained so early in the season it was as dead as the grave Just a handy place to meet the children in and look them over
before they were packed off to the Engadine or Leysin And besides the Wheaters had come there to pick up their new steam yacht the Fancy Girl a real beauty They were going on a short cruise in her
before they left for Cowes and Venice was a handy place to try her out By and by if Boyne liked he and Joyce and Wheater might drift out to the Piazza and take an ice at Florian s and a turn on the
Canal not very exciting but the best Wheater could suggest in the circumstances But Boyne said
why not stay where they were And Joyce with a shrug that just sufficiently displaced the jet strap attaching her dress to her white shoulder remarked that Cliffe never could stay where he was but that
nobody objected to his painting Venice red if he wanted to
Where d I get the paint at this time of year Nobody here but guys with guide books and old maids being photo d feeding the pigeons Hotels cram full of em Well look here about that tutor You
haven t come across anybody on your travels that would do Martin University chap and that sort of thing
Martin didn t believe he had but Mrs Wheater lifting a white arm to flick her cigarette into the Canal said I know a tutor
Hell you do her husband laughed incredulously Nother cigar old chap These Coronas ain t bad specially made for me He loosed the golden sheathings from a cigar and held his lighter to it
I know a tutor Mrs Wheater repeated Exactly the right person if only we can persuade him to take the job
Well I ll be blowed Where d you excavate him She was silent for a moment then she said I ve been going to the galleries with him It s the first
time I ve ever seen Venice Fanny Tradeschi got him out from England to tutor her boys and then she was bored here and rushed back to Paris and left him stranded His name is Ormerod Gerald
Ormerod It would be the greatest privilege for Terry if he could be persuaded Oh I guess I can persuade him all right I don t believe Fanny remembered to settle with him
before she left No she didn t but he s awfully proud You d better not take that tone with him Cliffe
What the tone of asking him what his screw is Shouting like that at the top of your lungs as if everybody less rich than yourself was deaf said
his wife with a slight steel edge in her silver voice
Hullo That the size of it Well fix it up with him any old way you like I m off for a round of the town Not coming along Martin Well so long Can t for the life of me see why you ve stuck
yourself down at that frowsy pension with the children I m sure I could have bullied the manager here into giving you a room Have it your own way though And you and Joyce can map out a tour for tomorrow only no galleries for me thank you Look here d ye think I d disturb Chipstone Wheater
Esqre if I was just to poke my head in and take a look at him on my way out Listen my shoes don t creak the least bit Oh hang it I don t care I m going to anyway

Of the Joyce Mervin of Boyne s youth the young Joyce Wheater of her early married days nothing apparently was left in the slim figure leaning over the balcony at Boyne s elbow Then she had been
large firm and rosy with a core of artless sensibility now she seemed to have gone through some process of dematerialization no doubt there were specialists for this too which had left a translucent
and imponderable body about a hard little kernel of spirit
It s impossible to make Cliffe feel nuances she murmured to her cigarette after Wheater had gone
then turning to Boyne But now we can have a good talk just like old times can t we She settled down in her armchair and exchanged her measured syllables for a sort of steely volubility which
rattled about Boyne s head like a hail of confetti She was awfully glad to see him really she was she declared he did believe her when she said that didn t he He d always been such a perfect friend in
the silly old days when she herself was just a stupid baby years younger in experience than Judy was now What did Martin think of Judy by the way Did he appreciate what a miracle the child was
Positively she was older and wiser than any of them and the only human being who had any influence whatever with Cliffe
Oh well Cliffe yes It was awfully dear and sweet of Martin to say that he was glad she and Cliffe had come together again and she was glad too and she was ever so proud of Chip and she did
recognize poor Cliffe s qualities she always had even when things were at their worst but there it was no use pretending with Martin it never had been and there was no denying that Cliffe had got
into dreadfully bad hands when she left him utterly demoralized and cowed by that beastly Lacrosse woman and the money pouring out like water Yes she Joyce had seen it was her duty to take him
back and so she had Because she still believed in the sanctity of marriage in spite of everything She hoped Martin did too For if you didn t what was there left to hold society together But all the same
if one came to feel that by living with a man even if he was one s husband one was denying one s Ideal that was awful too wasn t it Didn t Martin think it was awful
Yes Martin supposed it was but he rather thought a bunch of jolly children were a pretty good substitute for any old Ideal he d ever met Mrs Wheater laughed with somewhat more of the old
resonance and said she thought so too and that was what Judy had argued no Martin would never know how wonderful Judy had been during the ghastly days when Buondelmonte was dragging her
Joyce through the mire literally through the mire Why there were things I couldn t tell even you Martin
Martin felt his gorge rise Things I hope that Judy wasn t told then Mrs Wheater s shoulder again slipped its light trammels in a careless shrug Bless you you don t
have to tell the modern child things They seem to be born knowing them Haven t you found that out you dear old Rip van Winkle Why Judy s like a mother to me I assure you
She s got a pretty big family to mother hasn t she Boyne rejoined and Mrs Wheater sighed contentedly Oh but she loves it you know It s her hobby Why she tried to be a mother to Zinnia
Lacrosse Fancy a child of Judy s age attempting to keep a movie star straight She used to give good advice to Buondelmonte But that nightmare s over now and we re all together again and there s
only Terry poor darling to worry about I do worry about him you know Martin And isn t it sweet of him to want to be properly educated For Cliffe of course education has always just been college
sports and racing motors That s one reason why I ve missed so much but I am determined that Terry shall have all the opportunities I haven t had This tutor I was speaking about Gerald Ormerod
I wonder if you d see him for me to morrow Martin It s no use asking Cliffe he d just shout and brag and spoil the whole thing Gerald I ve got to calling him Gerald because Fanny Tradeschi always
did he comes of very good people you see and he s almost too sensitive too much of an idealist I can t tell you what it s been to me these last weeks to see Venice through the eyes of some one who
really cares for beauty You ll have a talk with him about Terry Martin dear I m sure Cliffe would give any salary you advise and it would be the saving of our poor Terry to be with some one really
sensitive and cultivated and Bun too he might put some sort of reason into Bun who s beginning

wo days later Boyne sat taking his morning coffee with Judith Wheater at a rickety iron table in the mouldy garden of the Pension Grimani He had bribed a maid to carry out their breakfast so that
they might escape the stuffiness of the low ceilinged dining room full of yesterday s dinner smells of subdued groups of old maids and giggling bands of school girls and of the too pervasive clatter of the
corner table about which Scopy and Nanny had gathered their flock It was Boyne s last day in Venice and he wanted a clear hour of it with Judith Presently the family would surge up like a spring tide
every one of them from Mr and Mrs Wheater with the Fancy Girl lying idle off San Giorgio and a string of unemployed motors at Fusina to Beechy and Zinnie squabbling over their new necklaces
from the Merceria and Miss Scope with a fresh set of problems for the summer all wanting Boyne s advice or sympathy or consolation or at least his passive presence at their debates All this was rather
trying and the eager proximity of the little Wheaters made privacy impossible Yet Boyne was more than ever glad that he had resisted the persuasions of their parents and carried his luggage to the
Pension Grimani instead of to the Palace Hotel The mere existence of Palace Hotels was an open wound to him Not that he was indifferent to the material advantages they offered Nobody
appreciated hot baths and white tiles electric bedlamps and prompt service more than he whose lot was usually cast in places so remote from them He loved Palace Hotels but he loathed the mere
thought of the people who frequented them
Judy he discovered was of the same mind Boyne had felt a little resentful of the fact that only the Wheaters youngest born was to share the luxury of their hotel it seemed rather beastly to banish the
others to frowsy lodgings around the corner At the moment he had avoided Judy s eye fearing to catch in it the reflection of his thought most of Judy s feelings were beginning to reverberate in him
But now in the leisure of their first talk since landing he learned that no such feeling had marred the meeting of the little Wheaters with their parents
Blanca Judith owned probably had minded a little just at first Silly Blanca she was always rather jealous of the fuss that Joyce and father made about Chip Besides she loved smartness and picking
up new ideas about clothes from the chic women in hotel restaurants and she liked to be seen about with Joyce who was so smart herself and to have other smart ladies say Is this your dear little girl
We should have known her anywhere from the likeness But it was precisely because of Blanca that Judith most disliked going to Palaces Ever since she
got engaged to the lift boy at Biarritz Engaged Boyne gasped But Judy but Blanca s barely eleven
Oh I was engaged myself at Blanca s age to a page at a skating rink Judith s small face as she made the admission had the wistful air of middle age looking back on the sweet follies of youth But
that was different He was a very nice little Swiss boy and I only gave him one of my hair ribbons and he gave me one of his livery buttons and when he went home for his holiday he sent me dried
edelweiss and forget me nots pasted on cards But these modern children are different Blanca s boy wanted a ring with a real stone in it and he was a horrid big thing with a fat nose that wriggled Terry
and I could hardly bear it And when Scopy found out about it she made an awful row and threatened to write to mother so altogether we re better off here In fact I wrote to father that we d better put up
at a place like this where the children can rush about and make a noise and nobody bothers I think it s rather jolly here don t you Martin
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She had called him Martin as a matter of course since the second day out from Algiers and he
could never hear his name in her fresh young trill without a stir of pleasure
He said he thought the Pension Grimani awfully jolly and was glad it suited the rest of them as well as it did him Then she asked if it was all right about Terry s tutor and what he thought of the young
man The answer to this was more difficult Boyne was not sure what he thought He had had an interview with Mr Ormerod on the previous day an interview somewhat halting and embarrassed on
his own part perfectly firm and self possessed on the tutor s Mr Ormerod was a good looking young Englishman with the University stamp upon him He had very fair hair somewhat long and rumpled
lazy ironic gray eyes and a discontented mouth He looked clever moody and uncertain but he was cultivated and intelligent and it seemed certain that Terry would learn more and be more usefully
occupied in his care than in Miss Scope s Boyne s embarrassment proceeded not only from the sense of his unfitness to choose a tutor for anybody but from the absurdity of having to do so with the
pupil s parents on the spot Mr Ormerod however seemed neither surprised nor disturbed He had seen Terry and was sure he was an awfully good little chap his only hesitation was as to the salary
Boyne who had fixed it to the best of his judgment saw at once that though it exceeded the usual terms it was below Mr Ormerod s mark The young man explained that the Princess Tradeschi had let
him down rather badly and that it was a beastly nuisance but he really couldn t give in about his screw Boyne remembered Mrs Wheater s parting injunction and to get over the difficulty suggested
throwing in Bun There s the little Buondelmonte boy a sort of step son he s rather a handful for the governess and perhaps you would take him on for part of the time In that case
This closed the transaction to Mr Ormerod s advantage and enabled Boyne to report to the Wheaters that their eldest son s education would begin the next day And now he had to answer
He strikes me as clever but I don t know how hard he ll make Terry work Oh Terry will make him work And as long as Joyce wants it I m glad it s settled If she hadn t
father might have kicked at the price Not that he isn t awfully generous to us but he can t see why people should want to be educated when they don t have to What does it ever lead to he says She
wrinkled her young brows pensively I don t know do you I can t explain But if Terry wants it I m sure it s right You ve read a lot yourself haven t you I don t suppose I shall ever care much about
reading but what s the use of bothering when I should never have a minute s time no matter how much I cared to do it
He reminded her that she might have time later and added that now that her parents were in an educational mood he wondered she didn t take advantage of it to get herself sent to a good school if
only to be able to keep up with Terry At this she smiled a little wistfully it was the same shy doubtful smile with which she had looked about her in the cathedral at Monreale trying to puzzle out what he
saw in it But her frown of responsibility returned Go to school Me But when I d like to know
There ll always be some of the children left to look after Why I shall be too old for school before Chip is anywhere near Terry s age And besides I never mean to leave the children never She brought the
word out with the shrill emphasis he had already heard in her voice when her flock had to be protected or reproved We ve all sworn that she added We took an awful oath one day at Biskra that we d
never be separated again no matter what happened Even Chip had to hold up his fist and say I swear We did it on Scopy s Cyclop dia of Nursery Remedies And if things went wrong again and I
was off at one of your schools who d see to it that the oath was kept But now that all the children are safely with your own people couldn t you let the oath take care of
itself and think a little of what s best for you She raised her eyes with a puzzled stare which made them seem as young as Zinnie s You d like me
to go to school He returned the look with one of equal gravity Most awfully
Her colour rose a little Then I should like to
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Well then
She shook her head and her flush faded I don t suppose you ll ever understand you or anybody
How could I leave the children now I ve got to get them off to Switzerland in another fortnight this is no place for Terry And suppose Mr Ormerod decides he won t come with us
Won t come with you But it s precisely what he s been engaged to do She gave an impatient shrug like her mother s and turned on Boyne a little face sharp with
interrogation Well then suppose it was mother who didn t want him to Your mother Why child it was she who found him She knows all about him she
She jolly well likes doing Venice with him Judy completed his sentence with a hideous promptness It was Boyne s turn to redden He averted his eyes from her with one of Miss Scope s
abrupt twists and pushed his chair back as if to get up Judy leant across the table and touched his sleeve timidly
I ve said something you don t like Martin You ve said something exceedingly silly Something I should hate to hear if you were grown up But
at your age it s merely silly and doesn t matter She was on her feet in a flash quivering with anger My age My age What do you know about my
age I m as old as your grandmother I m as old as the hills I suppose you think I oughtn t to say things like that about mother but what am I to do when they re true and there s no one but you that
I can say them to He never quite knew when she took that tone if he was most moved or offended by it There were
moments when she frightened him when he would have given the world to believe either that she was five years older than she said or else that she did not know the meaning of the words she used At such
moments it was always the vision of Rose Sellars which took possession of him and he found himself breathlessly explaining this strange child to her and feeling that what was so clear to him would
become incomprehensible as soon as he tried to make it clear to others and especially to Mrs Sellars
There s nothing to be done about it he thought despairingly Aloud he remarked in an impatient tone You re very foolish not to go to school
She made no reply but simply said with a return of her wistful look Perhaps if you were going to stay here you d lend me some books
But I m not going to stay here I m off to morrow morning he answered angrily keeping his head turned away with an irritated sense that if he should meet her eyes he would see tears in them
Her own anger had dropped he knew it without looking at her and he had the sense that she was standing near him very small and pale Martin if you d only stay There are so many things left
undecided Father and mother can t make up their minds where to go next and it s always when they ve got nothing particular to do that they quarrel They can t get anybody to go on the yacht with
them not till Cowes And if they have to chuck the cruise father wants to go to Paris and mother wants to go motoring in the hill towns of Italy where are they do you know And if they get
wrangling again what in the world is to become of us children He turned back then and put his hand on her arm There was an old bench as shaky as the table
under a sort of ragged sounding board of oleanders Sit down my dear He sat beside her smiling a little lighting a cigarette to prove his ease and impartiality You re taking all this much too hard you
know You ve too much on your shoulders and you re over tired that s all I ve been with your father and mother for two days now and I see no signs of anything going wrong The only trouble with them
is that they re too rich That makes them fretful it s like teething Every time your father hears he s made another million it s like cutting a new tooth They hurt to bite on when one has so many But he ll
find people soon to go off for a cruise with him and then he ll have to decide about your summer Your people must see that this place is not bracing enough for Terry and they ll want him to settle down
somewhere in the mountains and get to work as soon as possible

The tone of his voice seemed to quiet her though he suspected that at first she was too agitated to follow what he said But what sort of people she brought out at length disconsolately
What sort of people To go on the yacht That s another thing When mother is away from father and I m with her it s
easier in some ways except that then I fret about the other children When Joyce and father are together they do all sorts of crazy things just to be in opposition to each other Take up with horrid
people I mean people who drink and have rows And then they get squabbling again as they did when Buondelmonte sent father the bill for his Rolls Royce
Buondelmonte Yes but Joyce said we were never to talk about that she forbade us all
She was quite right Yes only it s true And they do get into all sorts of rows and muddles about the people they pick up
At this moment Boyne hearing a shuffle on the gravel looked around and saw the maid
approaching with a card The maid glanced doubtfully at the two and finally handed the card to Boyne as the person most likely to represent law and order in the effervescent party to which he
seemed to belong It was a very large and stiff piece of paste board bearing the name Marchioness of Wrench and underneath in a sprawling untaught hand To see my daughter Zinnie Wheater the
my being scratched out and her substituted for it Boyne after staring at this document perplexedly passed it on to Judith who sprang up with an astonished exclamation
Why it must be Zinnia Lacrosse Why she s married again It s true then what Blanca saw in the papers She looked inquiringly at Boyne Do you suppose she s really here
Of course I m here cried a sharp gay voice from the doorway and through the unkempt shrubbery an apparition sparkling with youth and paint and jewels swept toward them on a wave of perfume
Hullo Judy why it s you But the newcomer was not looking at Judith She stood still and scrutinised Boyne with great eyes set like jewels in a raying out of enamelled lashes She had a
perfectly oval face a small exquisitely curved mouth and an air of innocent corruption which gave Boyne a slightly squeamish feeling as she turned and flung her arms about Judy
Well old Judy I m glad to see you again Who s your friend she added darting a glance at Boyne through slanting lids All her gestures had something smooth and automatic and a little larger
He s Mr Boyne He s father s friend too This is Zinnia Lacrosse Martin No it isn t either It s the Marchioness of Wrench Only I m just called Lady Wrench except on
visiting cards and when they put me in the newspapers or I talk to the servants And of course you ll call me Zinnia just the same Judy How d ye do Mr Boyne murmured the star with an accession of
elegance and a languidly extended hand But she had already mustered Boyne and was looking over his shoulder as she addressed him What I m after is Zinnie you know she smiled Wrenny s
waiting in the gondola Wrenny s my husband and I ve promised to take her out and show her to him
She cast an ingratiating glance at Judith but the latter quietly facing her seemed to Boyne to have grown suddenly tall and authoritative as she did when she had to cope with a nursery mutiny
Now Zinnia she began in the shrill voice which always gave Boyne a sense of uneasiness you know perfectly well
Know what You know what the agreement is and you know Scopy and I aren t going to listen to anything
Fudge child What d you suppose I d want to break the agreement for Not that I care such an awful lot for Cliffe s old alimony you know It don t hardly keep me in silk stockings If I wanted to

carry Zinnie off that wouldn t stop me half a second But I only want to show Wrenny that I can have a baby if I choose Men are so funny about such things he doesn t believe I ve ever had one And of
course I can see he s got to have an heir Look here Judy ain t I always dealt with you white Let me see her right away won t you I ve got a lovely present for her here and one for you too a real
beauty Can t you understand a mother s feelings Judy still kept her adamantine erectness Her lips colourless and pressed together barely parted to
reply to the film star whose last advance she appeared not to have noticed
Of course you can see Zinnie You needn t get excited about that Only you ll see her here with me and Mr Boyne All your husband has got to do is to get out of the gondola and come into the house
If you d been brought up like a lady you d call him Lord Wrench Judy Judith burst out laughing Mercy Then you d better call me Miss Wheater But if you want to see
Zinnie you haven t got any time to lose because father s going to send for the children in a minute or two and take them all off on the yacht
Oh Judy but he can t prevent my seeing Zinnie Nobody wants to prevent you if you ll do what I say
The Marchioness of Wrench pondered this ultimatum for a moment staring down at her highly polished oval nails Then she said sullenly I ll try but I don t believe he ll get out of the gondola He s
dead lazy And we wanted to take Zinnie for a row Judith made no reply and finally Lady Wrench moved back toward the vestibule door with a reluctant step
I ll go and fetch Zinnie Judith announced to Boyne advancing to the house by another path but as she did so a small figure bedizened and glass beaded hurled itself across the garden and into her
Judy That was Zinnia wasn t it I saw her from my window Nanny said it wasn t but I knew it was She hasn t gone away without seeing her own little Zinnie has she I ll never forgive you if she
has Did she bring a present for me She always does Blanca s crazy to come down and see her clothes but Scopy won t let her She s locked her up
Judith gave one of her contemptuous shrugs Oh Scopy needn t have done that It won t hurt Blanca to see your mother There stop pinching me Zinnie and don t worry Your mother s coming
back She s only gone to get her husband to introduce him to you Her new husband What s his name Nobody ever told me she had a new husband Cos they
always say You re too little to understand Zif I wasn t Zinnia s own little daughter Judy hasn t she got a present for me don t you think If it s nothing but choc lates course I ll divvy with the others
but if it s jewelry I needn t need I Zinnie s ruddy curls spiralled upward and her face flamed with cupidity and eagerness With a flash of her dimpled fists she snatched the new Merceria beads from
her neck and thrust them into the pocket of her frock There s no use her seeing I ve had presents already you don t mind Martin do you she queried over her shoulder addressing Boyne who had
given her the necklace that morning He burst out laughing but Judith before he could intervene caught hold of the delinquent and gave her a wrathful shake You nasty false ungrateful little viper
you Oo oo oo wailed Zinnie hunching up her shoulders in a burst of sobs
There now Wrenny you just look at that I wish I had my lawyers here That s the way those Wheater people treat my child Lady Wrench stood in the garden door and pointed with a
denunciatory arm toward her weeping infant Over her shoulder appeared the fair hair and puzzled eyes of a very tall young man with a sickly cast of countenance a wide tremulous mouth and a bald
forehead Oh Lord my dear he said

VIII ady Wrench had snatched up her daughter and stood in an approved film attitude pressing
Zinnie s damp cheek against her own while the child s orange coloured curls mixed with the red gold of hers What s that nasty beast been doing to momma s darling she demanded glaring over
Zinnie s head at Judith Whipping you for wanting to see your own mother I suppose You just tell momma what it was and she ll
But Zinnie s face had cleared and she was obviously far too much absorbed in her mother s appearance to heed the unimportant questions which were being put to her She slid her fat fingers
through the pearls flowing in cataracts down Lady Wrench s bosom Oh Zinnia are they real Blanca says they can t be she knows they can t cos they re twice as big as Joyce s
Blanca Why is Blanca here Where is she Scopy s got her locked up so s she can t come down and stare at you but she found Martin s op ra

model s Joyce s jess ordered cos it ll make Joyce wild n she ll want to get another one instead as quick as she can Please Zinnia
Lady Wrench s brow had cleared as quickly as her daughter s She burst out laughing and pressed her lips to Zinnie s cheek There Wrenny what d you think of that I d like to know Isn t she my
really truly little girl Lord Wrench had shambled slowly forward in her wake He stood lax jointed irresolute in his light
loose flannels a faded Homburg hat tilted back from his perplexed brow gazing down on the group from the immense height to which his long limbs and endless neck uplifted him
Yes I ll take my oath she s that he replied in a voice which seemed to come from somewhere even higher than his hat and he gave a cackle that rose and overreached his voice and went tinkling away
His wife s laugh joined and outsoared his and she dropped down on the bench still hugging Zinnie
Judy thought we wanted to steal her Wrenny think of that Oh I forgot you didn t know each other Lord Wrench Judy Wheater And this is Mr Boyne a friend of Cliffe s aren t you a friend of
Cliffe s Mr Boyne My present husband the Marqu no that s wrong I know just my husband But where s Blanca Judy Do let her come down and Terry too that s a darling After all I m their stepmother ain t I Or I was anyhow Is Blanca as much of a beauty as ever Mr Boyne If that girl had
more pep I wouldn t wonder but what I could do something with her on the screen Judy now would never be any good to us would she Wrenny Too much of a lady I always used to tell her
Shut up here she is Lord Wrench interpolated As he spoke Judith reappeared with her younger sister Blanca s eyes were stretched to their widest at the sight of her former step mother though her
erect spine and measured tread betrayed nothing of her eagerness to appraise Lady Wrench s dress and jewels Behind them walked Miss Scope helmeted as if for a fray her hands mailed in gray cotton
and clutching her umbrella like a spear
Well Blanca How are you How you ve grown And what a looker you re going to be Only you re so fearfully grand always was wasn t she Judy You re a lady yourself but you ain t such a lady
Well Blanca shake hands and let me introduce you to my new husband Wrenny this is Blanca who used to come and stay with Terry and Judy when Cliffe and me were married Where s Terry Blanca
Why didn t he come down too I d love to see him

Terry s with his tutor at present said Blanca distantly though her eyes never for a second detached themselves from Lady Wrench s luminous presence
But he said he wouldn t have come down even if he hadn t of been chimed in Zinnie peering up maliciously into her mother s face He says he isn t quisitive like Blanca and he can t be bothered
every time somebody comes round to see the steps Lord Wrench at this joined Boyne in a fresh burst of laughter but his bride looked distinctly
displeased Well I see Terry s tutor hasn t taught him manners anyhow she snapped while Miss Scope admonished her youngest charge Inquisitive Zinnie you re really old enough to begin to
speak correctly No I m not less Bun and Beechy do too Zinnie retorted
Beatrice and Astorre are foreigners Miss Scope rejoined severely
Well so are you you old flamingo You re not a real true Merrican like us Zinnie cried Blanca intervening in her brother s behalf in her grandest manner Terry never said
any such thing but Zinnie secure in her mother s embrace laughed scorn at her rebukers until Judith remarked I m very sorry but children who are rude are not to be taken on the yacht today
Father particularly told me to tell you so Zinnie if you don t apologise at once to Miss Scope I m afraid you ll have to stay behind alone with Nanny
No she won t either my Zinnie pet won t She ll go out in the gond la with her own momma and her new father Lady Wrench triumphantly declared But Zinnie s expressive countenance had
undergone a sudden change She detached herself from the maternal embrace and sliding to the ground slipped across to Miss Scope and endearingly caught her by a gray cotton hand Scopy I m not
a really naughty Zinnie say I m not cos I don t want to go out in a bally old gond la I want to go n father s steam yacht I do
Fresh squeals of approval from Lord Wrench greeted this hasty retractation Jove she s jolly well right the kid is No doubt about her being yours Zinnia he declared whereat the lady rejoined with
an effort at lightness Zif I couldn t have a yacht of my own any day I like that d steam all round that old hulk of Cliffe s And I will too you ll see she added sweeping a circular glance about the
Righto Come along now and we ll pick one out her husband suggested with amiable irony
Well maybe I will she menaced rising to her feet with the air of throwing back an ermine train
But Blanca had advanced and was lifting shy eyes to hers Your dress is so perfectly lovely Zinnia I think it s the prettiest one I ever saw you in Isn t it from that Russian place mother s always talking
about where it s so hard to get them to take new customers The star cast a mollified smile upon her You bright child you Well yes it is But even if your
mother could persuade them to take her on she wouldn t be able to get this model because the Grand Duke Anastase designed it expressly for me and I ve got a signed paper saying it s the only one of the
kind they ll ever make See the way it s cut across the shoulders Blanca contemplated this detail with ecstatic appreciation and Lady Wrench gathering up her sable
scarf glanced victoriously about her I guess anybody that wants to can buy a steam yacht but you can count on one hand with two fingers missing the women that Anastase ll take the trouble to design
a dress for Oh I say come on old girl her husband protested shifting his weight wearily from one long leg to
another and Lady Wrench turned to follow him
Well goodbye Zinnie child Next time I ll call for you on my two thousand ton oil burner Oh look here seen my bag Wrenny I believe I brought some caramels for the child She turned back and
began to fumble in a bejewelled bag while the two little girls faces fell at the mention of caramels But presently a gold chain strung with small but lustrous pearls emerged from a tangle of cigarettes and

bank notes Here Zinnie you put that on and ask Blanca to look at the pearls under the microscope and then tell you if they re false like your momma s
Blanca paled at the allusion Oh Zinnia I never said yours were false Is that what that little brute told you I only said I couldn t be sure they weren t at that distance
Lady Wrench laughed imperturbably Well I should think you d have been sure they were being so accustomed to your mother s But movie queens don t have to wear fake pearls my pet cos if the real
ones get stolen they can always replace em You tell that to Mrs Cliffe Wheater number three And you needn t look so scared I bear no malice She drew a small packet from the bag See here s a ring
I brought you I guess that ll bear testing too she added flinging the little box into Blanca s hand
Blanca white with excitement snapped open the lid which revealed to her swift appraising eye a little ruby set in brilliants She drew it forth with a rapturous Oh Zinnia and slipped it onto her
hand hastily thrusting the box into a fold of her jumper
When I give presents I don t go to the ten cent store for them remarked Lady Wrench with a farewell wave of her hand So long everybody Shouldn t wonder if we met again soon by the sad sea
waves Wrenny and I are honeymooning out at the Lido and maybe you ll all be over for the bathing
It s getting to be as gay as it is in August All the smart people are snapping up the bathing tents The Duke of Mendip s got the one next to ours He s Wrenny s best friend you know By bye Judy Mr
Boyne hope you ll dine with us some night at the Lido Palace to meet the Duke Ask for the Marchioness of Wrench you ll remember
She vanished in a dazzle of pearls and laughter leaving Blanca and Zinnie in absorbed contemplation of their trinkets till Miss Scope marshalled them into the house to prepare for the
arrival of the Fancy Girl s launch
After the children were gone Judy lingered for a moment in the garden with Boyne Her features so tense and grown up looking during the film star s visit had melted into the small round face of a
Well that s over Boyne said flinging away his cigarette as though the gesture symbolised the act of casting out the Wrenches
Yes she assented in a tone of indifference Zinnia doesn t really matter you know she added as if noticing his surprise She screams a lot but she doesn t mean anything by it
Well I should think you d be glad she didn t for whatever she meant would be insufferable Judith raised her eyebrows with a faint smile We re more used to fusses than you are When there
are seven children and a lot of parents there s always somebody fighting about something But Zinnia s nothing like as bad as she looks She paused a moment and then irrepressibly as if to rid
her heart of an intolerable weight But Blanca got away with my present Did you see that I knew she would That s what she came down for to wangle it out of Zinnia Pretending she thought that old
Callot model was one of Anastase s There s nothing mean enough for Blanca Her eyes had filled with large childish tears and one of them rolled down her cheek before she had time to throw back her
head and add proudly Not that I care a straw of course I m too grown up to mind about such rubbish But I know Blanca must have noticed my nitials on the box Didn t you see how quick she was
about hiding it

he next day during the journey through the hot Veneto and up into the mountains the Wheater children and their problems were still so present to Boyne that he was hardly conscious of where
he was going or why
His last hours with his friends had ended on a note of happiness and security The new yacht filled and animated by that troop of irrepressible children whom it took all Miss Scope s energy and
ubiquity to keep from falling overboard or clambering to the mast head seemed suddenly to have acquired a reason for existing Cliffe Wheater in his speckless yachting cap and blue serge moved
about among his family like a beneficent giant and Mrs Wheater looking younger than ever in her white yachting skirt and jersey with her golden thatch tossed by the breeze fell into the prettiest
maternal poses as her own progeny and the steps scrambled over her in the course of a rough andtumble game organised by Boyne and the young tutor
The excursion had not begun auspiciously Before the start from the pension Bun and Beechy imprisoned above stairs during Lady Wrench s irruption had managed to inflict condign punishment
on Zinnie for not having them fetched down with Blanca and thus making them miss an exciting visit and probable presents Terry s indifference to the whole affair produced no effect on the irascible
Italians and as Zinnie when roused was a fighter and now had a gold necklace with real pearls to defend all Judith s influence and some cuffing into the bargain were needed to reduce the trio to
order after which Boyne had to plead that they should not be deprived of their holiday But once on the deck of the Fancy Girl all disagreements were forgotten It was a day of wind and sparkle with a
lagoon full of racing waves which made the yacht appear to be actually moving and after Beechy had drenched her new frock with tears of joy at being reunited to Chipstone and Blanca and Zinnie had
shown Lady Wrench s presents to every one from the captain to the youngest cook boy harmony once more reigned among the little Wheaters
Mr Ormerod with whom Terry was already at ease soon broke down the reserve of the others He proved unexpectedly good at games which involved scampering hiding and pouncing especially when
Joyce and Judith took part and could be caught and wrestled with and Cliffe Wheater parading the deck with Chip whom he had adorned with a miniature yachting cap with Fancy Girl on the ribbon
was the model of a happy father He pressed Boyne to chuck his other engagements and come off down the Adriatic as far as Corfu and Athens and Boyne lounging there in the bright air the children s
laughter encircling him and Judith perched on the arm of his chair asked himself why he didn t and what better life could have to offer Uncle Edward would certainly have accepted he thought while
his host pouring himself another cocktail from the deck table at his elbow went on persuasively
We ll round up a jolly crowd for you see if we don t Somebody s sure to turn up who ll jump at the chance Judy can t we hustle around and find him a girl
Here s all the girl I want Boyne laughed laying his hand on hers and a blush of pleasure rose to her face Oh Martin if you would oh can t you But even that he had resisted even the ebb of her
colour when he shook his head The wandering man s determination to stick to his decisions was strong in him Too many impulses had solicited him in too many lands it was because despite a lively
imagination he had so often managed to resist them that a successful professional career lay behind him and ahead he hoped comparative leisure and the haven he wanted
He had tried to find a farewell present for Judith some little thing which in quality if not costliness should make up for her disappointment at being done out of Lady Wrench s Judith s frank
avowal of that disappointment had been a shock to him but he reflected again what a child she was and called himself a prig for expecting her standards to be other than those of the world she lived in
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html After all he had had no time to search for anything rare and could only push into her hand at the last
moment a commonplace trinket from the Merceria but her childish joy in it and her way of showing that she valued it doubly because it came from him made the parting from her harder And now alone
in the dusty train he was asking himself why he had not stayed in Venice
As a matter of fact there were several reasons among them the old fashioned one that months before he had promised to meet Mrs Sellars in the Dolomites In a world grown clockless and
conscienceless Boyne was still punctual and conscientious and in this case he had schooled himself to think that what he most wanted was to see Rose Sellars again Deep within him he knew it was not so
at least not certainly so Life had since given him hints of other things he might want equally want even more his reluctance to leave Venice and his newly acquired friends showed that his inclinations
were divided But he belonged to a generation which could not bear to admit that naught may abide but mutability He wanted the moral support of believing that the woman who had once seemed to fill
his needs could do so still She belonged to a world so much nearer to his than the Wheaters and their flock that he could not imagine how he could waver between the two Rose Sellars s world had always
been the pole star of his whirling skies the fixed point on which his need for permanence could build
He could only conclude now that he combined with the wanderer s desire for rest the wanderer s dread of immobility Hang it all you can t have it both ways he rebuked himself but secretly he
knew that that was how the heart of man had always craved it
Had all that happened only forty eight hours ago Now as he sat on the balcony of the ch let over against the mighty silver and crimson flanks of the Cristallo group the episode had grown incredibly
remote and Boyne saw his problems float away from him like a last curl of mist swallowed up in the blue behind the peaks
Simply change of air he wondered The sudden rise into this pure ether that was like a shouting of silver trumpets Partly perhaps and all that had chanced to go with it in this wonderful resurrection
of a life he had secretly thought dead
Bethesda is what you ought to call this he murmured to himself It was so like Rose Sellars the live Rose Sellars who had already replaced his delicately embalmed mummy of her to have found this
ch let on the slope above the big hotels a place so isolated and hidden that he and she were alone in it with each other and the mountains How could he have so underrated his old friend s sense of the
wonder of the place and of what she owed to it as to suppose that even for two or three weeks she would consent to be a number in a red carpeted passage and feed with the rest of the numbers in a
blare of jazz and electricity The ch let was only just big enough for herself and her maid and the cook who prepared their rustic meals had there been a corner for Boyne she assured him that he should
have had it But perhaps it added to the mystery and enchantment that to see her he had to climb from the dull promiscuity of his hotel into a clear green solitude alive with the tremor of water under
meadow grasses and guarded by the great wings of the mountains
You do really like it she had asked as they sat the first evening on the balcony smelling of firwood and watched the cliffs across the valley slowly decompose from flame to ashes
I like it most of all for being so like you he answered
She laughed and turned an amused ironic face on him a face more than ever like one of those light three crayon drawings of which she had always reminded him Like me Which the ch let or the
Cristallo group Well both that s the funny part of it
It must make me seem a trifle out of drawing No first aloof and aloft and then again small and sunny and near
She sighed faintly and then smiled Well I prefer the last part of the picture I d a good deal rather be a sunny balcony than a crystal peak But I enjoy looking out on the peak
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html There you are that s what I meant It s the view from you that I ve missed so all these years
She received this in a silence softened by another little laugh The silence seemed to say That will do for our first evening the laugh But I like it you know
Aloud she remarked I m glad you came up here after Venice and the millionaires It s all to the good for the mountains and for me
Their first direct talk about themselves had ended there drifting away afterward into reminiscences questions allusions the picking up of threads a gradual leisurely reconstruction of their five years
apart Now on this second evening he felt that he had situated her once more in his own life and established himself in hers So far he had made no allusion to his unsatisfied passion In the past by
her own choice her sternly imposed will their relation had been maintained in the strict limits of friendship and for the present he found it easier more natural to continue on the same lines It was
neither doubt nor pride that held him back nor any uncertainty as to her feeling but simply his sense of the wellbeing of things as they were In the course of his life so much easy love had come his way he
had grown so weary of nights without a morrow that he needed to feel there was one woman in the world whom he was half afraid to make love to Rose Sellars had chosen that he should know her only
as the perfect friend just at first he thought he would not disturb that carefully built up picture If he had suspected a rival influence he would not have tolerated delay but as they travelled together over
her past he grew more and more sure that it was for him the cold empty years of her marriage had kept her Manlike he was calmed rather than stimulated by this though he would have repudiated more
indignantly than ever the idea that she was less desirable because she was to be had As a matter of fact he found her prettier and younger than when they had parted Every change in her was to her
advantage and he had instantly discarded his sentimental remembrance of her dense coils of silveryauburn hair and draperies falling to the ankles in favour of the new woman which her hair dressed to look short and her brief skirts had made of her Freedom of spirit and of body had mysteriously
rejuvenated her and he found her far more intelligent and adaptable than he had guessed when their relation had been obscured by his passion and her resistance Now there was no resistance and his
passion lay with folded wings It was perfect
Every day they went off on an excursion Sometimes they hired a motor leaving it far afield for a long climb but neither could afford such luxuries often nor did they much care for them Usually they
started on foot with stick and rucksack getting back only as the great cliffs hung their last lustre above the valley Mrs Sellars was a tireless walker proud of her light foot and firm muscles She loved all the
delicate detail revealed only to walkers the thrust of orchis or colchicum through pine needles the stir of brooks the uncurling of perfumed fronds the whirr of wings in the path and that continual
pulsation of water and wind and grasses which is the heart beat of the forest Boyne always alive to great landscape had hitherto been too busy or preoccupied to note its particulars It was years since he
had rambled among mountains without having to look at them with an engineering eye and calculate their relation to a projected railway or aqueduct and these walks opened his eyes to unheeded
beauties It was like being led through the flowered borders of an illuminated missal of which he had hitherto noticed only the central pictures
Better still were the evenings When he first came a full moon held them late on the balcony listening and musing and sent him down dizzy with beauty through the black fir shadows to his hotel
When the moon had waned and the nights were fresh or cloudy they sat by the fire and talked and talked or turned over new books and reviews Boyne with his bones and his brain so full of hard
journeys and restless memories thought he would have liked to look forward to an eternity of such evenings in just such a hushed lamplit room with a little sparkle of fire reviews and papers
everywhere and that quiet silvery auburn head with its mass of closely woven braids bending over a book across the hearth Rose Sellars s way of being silently occupied without seeming absorbed was
deeply restful And then her books She always managed to have just the ones he wanted to get hold of to a homeless wandering man it was not the least of her attractions Once taking up a volume they
had been talking of Boyne recalled Judith Wheater s wistful Perhaps you might lend me some
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html books From what fold of memory had the question and the very sound of the girl s voice come
back to him He was abruptly reminded that it was a long time since he had given a thought to the little Wheaters
There had been so many years to cover in the exchange of reminiscences that he had not yet touched on his encounter with them and Mrs Sellars seemed to have forgotten the description of the little
band which had amused her in his letters But now he was reminded with a pang of the contrast between her ordered and harmonious life she always reminded him of Milton s How charming is
divine philosophy and the chaotic experiences of the poor little girl who for a moment had displaced her image Inconceivably vulgar and tawdry sordid and inarticulate under all the shouting and the
tinsel seemed that other life and those who led it Boyne would have brushed the vision away with contempt but for the voice which had called to him out of the blur With a sigh he put down the book
he had opened Mrs Sellars who sat at the table writing looked up and their eyes met What were you thinking of
He had a start of distrust the first since he had been with her Would she understand if he tried to explain if she did would she sympathize He shrank from the risk and evaded it Seeing you so hard
at work reminds me of all the letters I haven t written since I ve been here She arched her eyebrows interrogatively and he was sure she was thinking Why doesn t he tell me
that he s no one to write to when he s with me Aloud she said You know I m burdened with any number of fond relations who are consumed with the desire to know how I m spending my first
holiday You re a wonderful correspondent
As if scenting irony she rejoined So are you I haven t been since I came here
Well come and share the inkpot She made the gesture of pushing it over to him but he shook his head and stood up The night s too lovely Put on your cloak and come out on the balcony
She held her pen suspended her eyes following his On the balcony But there s no moon Because there s no moon he insisted smiling
At that smiling too she drifted out to him

You will say I ought not to tell you this dear Martin then what can I do if there is a Row between them about Gerald Terry will loose his tutor and its too bad so I want to get away with the children as quick as we can
Terry said he must see this before I send it to you because I spell so badly but I wont let him because hed stop me sending it
Please Martin dear I do imploar you write and tell father to send us off quickly Terry s temprature has gone up and Ime worried about everything How I wish you were here then theyde do what you say
Your Judith who misses you P S Please dont tell the Wheaters that Ive written
Boyne s first thought as he put the letter down was that he was glad it had come after what had happened that very evening on the balcony There had happened simply that the barriers created by a
long habit of reticence had fallen and he had taken Rose Sellars into his arms It was a quiet embrace the hushed surface of something deep and still She had not spoken he thanked his gods for that
Almost any word might have marred the moment tied a tag to it and fitted it with others into some dusty pigeon hole of memory She had known how to be different and that was exquisite Their quiet
communion had silently flowered and she had let it There was neither haste nor reluctance in her but an acquiescence so complete that what was deepest in both of them had flowed together through their
It will be so much easier now to consult her she ll understand so much better He didn t quite know why he felt that perhaps because the merging of their two selves seemed to
include every claim that others could have on either of them Only yesterday he might have felt a doubt as to how Mrs Sellars would view the Wheater problem what she could possibly have in common with
any of the Wheaters or their world now it was enough that she had him in common and must share the burden because it was his
He went over Judith s letter again slowly imagining how Mrs Sellars s beautiful eyes would deepen as she read it The very spelling was enough to wring her heart He would take the letter to her the next
day But the next day was here already He pushed back his window and leaned out In the cold colourless air a few stars were slowly whitening while behind the blackness of the hillside facing him
the interstellar pallor flowed imperceptibly into morning gold His happiness he thought was like that passing of colourless radiance into glow It was joy enough to lean there and watch the transmutation
Was it a sign of middle age he wondered to take beatitude so quietly Well Rose for all her
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
buoyancy was middle aged too Then he remembered their kiss and laughed the word away as the sun rushed up over the mountains
All that day there was too much to do and to say there were too many plans to make too many memories to retrace Boyne did not forget Judith Wheater s letter her problem lay like a vague
oppression in the background of his thoughts but he found no way of fitting it into the new pattern of his life Just yet
It was decided that he and Mrs Sellars should linger on in the mountains for another month a month of mighty rambles long hours of summer sunlight and nights illuminated by a waxing moon
After that Boyne s idea had been that they should push on at once to Paris and there be married as quickly as legal formalities allowed It was at this hint of an immediate marriage that he first noticed
in Mrs Sellars the recoil of the orderly deliberate woman whose life has been too vacant for hurry too hopeless for impatience Theoretically she told him with a smile she hated delay and fuss as much as
he did and how could he question her eagerness to begin their new life But practically she reminded him there were difficulties there might even be obstacles Oh not real ones of course She laughed
that away remarking with a happy blush that she was of age and her own mistress Well then he interjected Well there were people who had to be considered who might be offended by too great
haste her husband s family for instance She had never hit it off with them particularly well as Boyne knew but that was the very reason she insisted why she must do nothing that might give them
cause Cause for what Well to say unpleasant things She couldn t possibly marry within a year of her husband s death without seriously offending them and latterly she had to admit they had
been very decent especially about straightening out Charles s will which had been difficult to interpret Mr Dobree said
Mr Dobree He s been such a friend to me through everything you know she reminded him a shade
reproachfully and he remembered then that Mr Dobree was the New York lawyer who had unravelled as much as possible to her advantage the tangle of Charles Sellars s will the will of a
snubbed secretive man whose only vindictiveness had been posthumous Mr Dobree had figured a good deal of late in Mrs Sellars s letters and she had given Boyne to understand that it was he who
had brought the Sellars family to terms about the will Boyne vaguely remembered him as a shy selfimportant man with dark gray clothes that were always too new and too well cut the kind of man whose Christian name one never knew but had to look up in the Social Register and then was
amused to find it was Jason or Junius only to forget it again at once so fatally did Mr Dobree tend always to become Mr Dobree once more A man in short who would have been called common in the
New York of Boyne s youth but now figured as a gentleman of the old school and conscientiously lived and dressed up to the character Boyne suspected him of being in love with Mrs Sellars and
Mrs Sellars of feeling though she could not return the sentiment that it was not ungratifying to have inspired it But Boyne s mind lingered on Mr Dobree only long enough to smile at him as the rejected
suitor and then came back to his own grievances
You don t mean to say you expect me to wait a whole year from now She laughed again You goose A year from Charles s death It s only seven months since he died
What of that You were notoriously unhappy Oh notoriously
He met her protest with a smile I admit the term is inappropriate But I don t suppose anybody thinks your marriage was unmitigated bliss
Don t you see dear That s the very reason Oh hang reasons especially unreasonable ones Why have you got to be unhappy now because
you were unhappy then
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html I m not unhappy now I don t think I could be ever again if I tried
Dear he rejoined She excelled at saying nice things like that and was aware of it but her doing so now was like putting kickshaws before a hungry man It s awfully sweet of you he continued but
I shall be miserable if you insist on things dragging on for another five months To begin with I m naturally anxious to get home and settle my plans I want some sort of a job as soon as I can get it and
I want you he concluded putting his arm about her
Obviously what struck her first in this appeal was not his allusion to wanting her but to the need of settling his plans All her idle married years he knew had been packed with settling things adjusting
things adapting things disguising things She did see his point she agreed at once and she wanted as much as he did to fix a date but why shouldn t it be a later one There were her own aunts too who
had always been so kind Aunt Julia in particular would be as horrified as the Sellarses at her marrying before her year of mourning was over and she particularly wanted to consider Aunt Julia
Why do you particularly want to consider Aunt Julia I seem to remember her as a peculiarly stupid old lady
Yes dear she agreed But it s just because she is peculiarly stupid If you call that a sufficient reason we shall never get married In a family as large as yours there ll
always be somebody stupid left to consider Thanks for your estimate of my family But it s not the only reason Her colour rose a little You
see I m supposed to be Aunt Julia s heir I found it out because as it happens Mr Dobree drew up her will and the doctors say any one of these attacks of gout
Oh He couldn t keep the disenchanted note out of his voice The announcement acted like a cold
douche It ought in reason to have sent a pleasant glow through him for he knew that in spite of Mr
Dobree s efforts Mrs Sellars had been left with unexpectedly small means and the earnings of his own twenty years of hard work in hard climates had been partly lost in unlucky investments The kind
of post he meant to try for in New York as consulting engineer to some large firm of contractors was not likely to bring in as much as his big jobs in the past and the appearance of a gouty aunt with
benevolent testamentary designs ought to have been an unmixed satisfaction But trimming his course to suit the whims of rich relations had never been his way perhaps because he had never had any rich
relations Anyhow he was not going to be dictated to by his wife s and it gave him a feeling of manliness to tell her so
Of course if it s a case of choosing between Aunt Julia and me he began severely
She raised her eyebrows with that soft mockery he enjoyed so much when it was not turned against himself In that case dear I should almost certainly choose you
Well then pack up and let s go straight off to Paris and get married Martin you ought to understand I can t be married before my year of mourning s out For my own
sake I can t and for yours Damn mine
Very well I have my personal reasons that I must stick to even if I can t make you understand them Her eyes filled and she looked incredibly young and wistful I don t suppose I ought to expect
You ought to expect me to understand anything that s even remotely reasonable I had hoped so
Oh dash it he began and then broke off With a secret dismay he felt their lovers talk degenerating for the first time into a sort of domestic squabble if indeed so ungraceful a term could be
applied to anything as sweetly resilient as Rose s way of gaining her end Was marriage always like that Was the haven Boyne had finally made to be only a stagnant backwater like other people s Or
was it because he had been wandering and homeless for so long that the least restraint chafed him and
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
arguments based on social considerations made him fume He was certainly in no position to quarrel with Mrs Sellars for wishing to better her fortunes and the discussion ended by his lifting her hand to
his lips and saying You know I want only what you want The coward s way out and he knew it But since he had parted with the substance of his independence why cling to the form He felt her eyes
following his inner debate and knew that the sweetness of her smile was distilled out of satisfaction at his defeat Damn it he thought what cannibals marriage makes of people He suddenly felt as if
they were already married as if they had been married a long time
During their first fortnight not a cloud had shadowed their comradeship but now that love and marriage had intervened the cloud was there no bigger than the Scriptural one but menacing as that
proverbial vapour She was kinder than ever because she had gained her point and he knew it was because she had gained her point But was it not his fault if he had begun thus early to distinguish
among her different qualities as if they belonged to different vintage years and to speculate whether the quality of her friendship might not prove more exquisite than her love could ever be He was
willing to assume the blame since the joy of holding her fast of plunging into her enchanted eyes and finding his own enchantment there was still stronger than any disappointment If love couldn t be
friendship too as he had once dreamed it might the only thing to do was to make the most of what it was
Judith Wheater s letter had been for over a week in Boyne s pocket when he pulled it out crumpled and smelling of tobacco
He and Mrs Sellars were reclining at ease on a high red ledge of rock with a view plunging down by pine clad precipices pastures and forests to illimitable distances of blue Dolomite The air sang with
light the smell of crushed herbs rose like incense and the hearts of the lovers were glad with sun and wind and the glow of a long climb followed by such food as only a rucksack can provide
And now for a pipe Boyne said in sleepy beatitude stretching himself out on the turf at Mrs
Sellars s elbow He fumbled for his tobacco pouch and drew out with it the forgotten letter
Oh dash it What
Poor little thing I forgot this I meant to show it to you days ago Who s the poor little thing
For a moment he wavered His old dread of her misunderstanding returned and he felt he could not bear to have her misunderstand that letter What was the use of showing it after all But she was
holding out her hand and he had no alternative She raised herself on her elbow and bent her lustrous head above the page From where he lay he watched her profile and the subtle curves of the line from
ear to throat How lovely she still is he thought
She read attentively frowning a little in the attempt to decipher Judith s spelling and her mouth melting into amusement or compassion Then she handed back the letter I suppose it s from the little
Wheater girl you wrote about Poor little thing indeed It s too dreadful I didn t know there really were such people But who are the Wheaters she speaks of in the postscript who are not to be told
Boyne replied that those were her parents
Her parents Why does she speak of them in that way He explained that in the Wheater circles it was the custom among the children to do so the cross
tangle of divorces having usually given them so many parents that it was more convenient to differentiate the latter by their surnames
Oh Martin it s too horrible Are you serious Did the poor child really tell you that The governess did as a matter of course
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
She made a little grimace The sort of governesses they must have in a world where the parents are like that
Well this particular one is a regular old Puritan brick She and Judith keep the whole show together And he told her about the juvenile oath on Scopy s Cyclop dia of Nursery Remedies
She doesn t appear to have grounded her pupils very thoroughly in spelling Mrs Sellars commented but her eyes were soft and she took the letter back and began to read it over again
There s a lot I don t begin to understand Who are these people that Mrs Wheater wants to invite on the yacht because they know a Duke and Mr Wheater won t because it s too low
They re Lord and Lady Wrench Wasn t there a lot in the papers a month or two ago about Lord Wrench s marrying a movie star He has a racing stable I believe he s very rich Her name was Zinnia
Lacrosse A perfect name But why in the Wheater world are movie stars regarded as too low Too low for
what or for whom Her mouth narrowed disdainfully on the question
Well this one happens to have been Wheater s wife for a time His wife
Not for long though They ve been divorced for much longer than they were married So I suppose Mrs Wheater doesn t see the use of making a retrospective fuss about it
Practical woman And who s the Gerald that she and the other lady are fighting for Oh he s the boy s tutor Terry s tutor Or was to have been I m afraid he s a rotter too But Terry
poor chap is the best fellow you ever saw I back him and Judith and Scopy to keep the ship on her course whatever happens If only Terry s health holds out
And they get him another tutor As things go he s lucky if he has any
Mrs Sellars again sighed out her contempt and amazement and let the letter fall For a long time she sat without moving her chin on her hand looking out over the great billowing landscape which
rolled away at their feet as if driven on an invisible gale When she turned to Boyne he saw that her eyes were full of a puzzled sadness Don t the Wheaters care in the least about their children
In old days in their melancholy inconclusive talks she had often confessed her grief at being childless and now he heard in her voice the lonely woman s indignation at the unworthiness of those
who had been given what she was denied Don t they care she repeated
Oddly enough I believe they do I m afraid that s going to be our difficulty Why should they have taken on the steps if they hadn t cared They certainly seem very fond of the children whenever
they re with them But it s one thing to be fond of children and another to know how to look after them My impression is that they realised their incapacity long ago and that s why they dumped the
whole problem on Judy Long ago But how old is Judy This is the writing of a child of ten
She s had no time to learn any other with six children to look after But I suppose she s fifteen or sixteen
Fifteen or sixteen Mrs Sellars gave a little sigh Young enough to be my daughter It was on the tip of his tongue to say I wish she had been But he had an idea it might sound
queerly and instead he stretched out his hand and took back the letter The gesture seemed to rouse her to a practical view of the question What are you going to do about it dearest
That s what I want you to tell me This stimulated her to action as he had known it would He was glad that he had consulted her she
had been full of sympathy and might now be of good counsel How stupid it was ever to mistrust her
Of course you must write to her father

Well perhaps But doing that won t get us much forrarder Not if you appeal to him point out that the children oughtn t to be kept in Venice any longer
Didn t you say he knew the climate was bad for the boy Yes and Wheater will respond at once in words He ll say Damn it Joyce Boyne s right What
are the children doing here We ll pack them off to the Engadine to morrow Then he ll cram my letter into his pocket and no one will ever see it again except the valet when he brushes his coat
But the mother Joyce or whatever her name is If he tells her Well there s the hitch
What hitch Supposing she wants to keep the children in Venice on account of Gerald
Gerald Oh the tutor Oh Martin A shiver of disgust ran over her And you dare to tell me she s fond of her children
So she is awfully fond But everything rushes past her in a whirl Life s a perpetual film to those people You can t get up out of your seat in the audience and change the current of a film
What can you do about it He lay back on the grass frowning up into the heavens Can t think Unless I were to drop down to
Venice for a day or two and try talking to them To his surprise he found that the idea opened out before him rather pleasantly Writing to that kind of people s never any sort of good he concluded
Mrs Sellars was sitting erect beside him her eyes bent on his They had darkened a little and the delicate bend of her lips narrowed as it had when she asked what there could be in the Wheater world
that movie stars were too low for
Go back to Venice He felt the edge of resistance in her voice I don t see of what use that would be It s a good deal to ask you to take that stifling journey again And if you don t know what to write
how would you know any better what to say Perhaps I shouldn t But at any rate I could feel my way And I might comfort Judith a little
Poor child I wish you could She was all sweetness again But I should try writing first Don t you think so Write to her too of course Whatever you decide you d better begin by feeling your way It s
always awkward to interfere in family matters and if you turned up again suddenly the Wheaters might think it rather odd
He was inclined to tell her that nothing would seem odd to the Wheaters except what seemed inevitable and fore ordained to her But he felt an irritated weariness of the whole subject I daresay
you re right he agreed pocketing his pipe and getting to his feet It was not his idea of a holiday that it should be interfered with by other people s bothers and he put Judith s letter back into his pocket
with an impatient thrust After all what business was it of his He would write the child a nice letter of course but Rose was right the idea of going down to Venice was absurd Besides Judith s letter
was more than a week old and ten to one the party had scattered by this time and the children were safe somewhere in the mountains Poor little thing she s always rather overwrought and very likely
she just had a passing panic when she wrote Hang it I wish she hadn t written he concluded relieved to find a distant object for his irritation
Arm in arm he and his love wandered down the mountain

f course I ve written to her I wrote last night Boyne assured Mrs Sellars the next evening He was conscious of a vague annoyance at being called to account in the matter as if he couldn t
deal with his own correspondence without such reminders But Mrs Sellars s next word disarmed him
I m so glad dear I should have hated to feel that our being so happy here had made you neglect your little friend
That was generous he thought and like her He adored her when she said things like that It proved that in spite of her little air of staidness she was essentially human and comprehending He had
persuaded her that night for fun for a change after her months of seclusion to come down and dine with him not at his own modest hotel but at the towering Palace among the pines below the ch let
where he thought the crowd and gaiety of the big restaurant might amuse her and would at any rate make their evenings at the ch let more delicious by contrast
They had finished dining and were seated over their coffee in a corner of the big panelled hall to which the other diners were slowly drifting back Boyne seeing Mrs Sellars for the first time since his
arrival in the company of women as graceful and well dressed as herself noted with satisfaction that not one of them had exactly her quality But the groups about the other tables were amusing to study
and speculate about and he sat listening to her concise and faintly ironic comments with an enjoyment mellowed by the flavour of the excellent cigar he had acquired from the head waiter
The girl in peach colour over there by the column lovely isn t she Only one has seen her a thousand times in all the Vogues and Tatlers Oh Martin won t it be too awful if beauty ends by
being standardised too Boyne rather thought it had been already in the new generation and secretly reflected that Mrs
Sellars s deepest attraction lay in her belonging to a day when women still wore their charm with a difference
I m sure if I owned one of these new beauties I shouldn t always be able to pick her out in a crowd he agreed
She laughed her satisfaction and then sweeping the hall with lifted eye glass That one you would
A new beauty Where Beauty no Hardly pretty but different The girl who s just come in Where s she vanished to
Oh she s speaking to the porter Now she s looking this way but you can t see her from where you re sitting She s hardly more than a child but the face is interesting
He barely caught the last words The porter had come up with a message Young lady asking for you sir Boyne got to his feet staring in the direction indicated He had not been mistaken It was
Judith Wheater who stood there frail and straight in her scant travelling dress her hat pulled down over her anxious eyes so small and dun coloured that she was hardly visible among those showy barearmed women Yet Mrs Sellars had picked her out at once Yes there was something undeniably
different just as there was about Mrs Sellars herself But this was no time for such considerations
Where on earth had the child come from and what on earth had brought her
Wait a minute will you It s some one I know He followed the porter between the tables to where Judith stood in the shadow of the stairway
Child Where in the world have you dropped from

Oh Martin Martin I was so afraid you d gone He caught her by both hands and she lifted a drawn little face to his Well why not He had kissed
her goodbye in Venice now he touched his lips to her cheek Judy how in the world did you get here
Have the heads of the clan come too Oh Martin Martin She kept fast hold of him and he felt that she was trembling She paid no
attention to his question but turned and glanced about her Isn t there a writing room somewhere that we could go to There s never anybody in them after dinner
He guided her still clinging to him to one of the handsomely appointed rooms opening off the corridor beyond the hall As she had predicted its desks were deserted its divans unoccupied She
dropped down by Boyne and threw her arms about his neck
Oh Martin say you re glad I must hear you say it Glad child Of course I m glad Very gently he released himself But you look dead beat Judy
What s the matter Has anything gone wrong Are your people here She drew back a little and turned full on him her most undaunted face If you mean father and
mother they re in Venice They don t know we re here You mustn t be angry Martin we ve run away Run away Who s run away
All of us with Scopy and Nanny I always said we d have to some day Scopy and Terry and I managed it We re at the Pension Rosengl h down the hill Father and mother will never guess we re
here They think we ve gone to America on the Cunarder that touched at Venice yesterday I left a letter to say we had Terry was splendid he invented it all We hired motors at Padua to come here But I m
afraid he s dreadfully done up This air will put him right though won t it She poured it all out in the same tone of eager but impartial narrative as if no one statement in her tale were more surprising or
important than the others except of course the matter of Terry s health The air here is something wonderful Martin isn t it she pleaded and he found himself answering with conviction There s
simply nothing like it Her face instantly grew less agitated I knew I was right to come she sighed in a tired voice and he
felt as if she were indeed an overwrought child and the next moment might fall asleep on his shoulder
Judy you re dreadfully done up yourself and you look famished It s after ten Have you had anything to eat since you got here
I don t believe I have There wasn t time I had to see the children settled first and then make sure you were here
Of course I m here But before we do any more talking you ve got to be fed Well it would be nice to have a bite she confessed recovering her usual confident tone
Wait here and I ll go and forage Boyne walked down the corridor and back into the hall where people were beginning to group themselves about the bridge tables The fact of finding himself there
roused him to the recollection of having left Mrs Sellars alone with his empty coffee cup Till that moment he had forgotten her existence He made his way back to their corner but it was deserted In
the so called salon against a background of sham tapestries and gilt wall lights other parties were forming about more bridge tables but there also there was no sign of Mrs Sellars
Oh well she s got bored and gone home he thought a little irritably Surely it would have been simpler and more friendly to wait but that was just a part of her ceremoniousness Probably she had
thought it more tactful to disappear Damn tact That was all he had to say The important thing now was to give Judy something to eat and get her back to her pension After that he would run up to the
He found a waiter learned that it was too late to resuscitate dinner and ordered ham sandwiches and cocktails to be brought at once to the writing room On the whole he found it simplified things to
have Mrs Sellars out of the way Perhaps there was something to be said for tact after all
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
The first sip of her cocktail brought the glow back to Judith s eyes and lips the next made her preternaturally vivid and alert She must eat he told her eat at once before she began to talk and he
pushed his own sandwiches on to her plate and watched her devouring them and emptying first her glass and then his She sparkled at him across its brim but kept silence obediently then she asked for
a cigarette and leaned back at ease against the cushions
Well we re all here she declared with satisfaction
Not Chip he questioned incredulous
Chip I should think so Do you suppose I d have stirred an inch without Chip But what the deuce is it all about child Have you gone crazy all of you
Father and mother have They do you know I warned father we d run away if it happened again What happened
Why what I told you would But I don t suppose you ever got my letter I was sure you d have answered it if you had She turned her eyes on him with a look of such unshaken trust that he
stammered uncomfortably Tell me all about it now Well everything went to smash I knew it would And then all the old shouting began about
detectives and lawyers and mother s alimony You know that s what the children mean when they talk about mother s old friend Sally Money They ve heard about her ever since they can remember They
think mother sends for her whenever anything goes wrong And things have gone thoroughly wrong
Worse than ever They were dividing us up already Bun and Beechy back to Buondelmonte because he s married a rich American And Zinnia is ready to take Zinnie Lord Wrench thinks she s so
awfully funny And father would have had Chip of course and we three older ones would have begun to be sent back and forth again as we used to be like the shabby old books Scopy used to get out of the
lending library at Biarritz You could keep the stupid ones as long as you liked but the jolly ones only a week She turned her burning face to his Now Martin didn t I have to get them all away from it
The food and wine had sent such a flame through her that he began to wonder if she had fever or if it were only the glow of fatigue He took her hand and it was burning like her face
Child you re too tired All the rest will keep till to morrow Put on your hat now and I ll take you down the hill to your pension
But Martin you ll promise and swear to see us through Through everything bless you On Scopy s book And now come along or you ll fall asleep in your
tracks In reality he had never seen her so acutely wakeful but she submitted in silence to being bundled
into her hat and coat and linked her arm confidingly in his as they threaded their way among the bridge players and out into the great emptiness of the night The moon hung low above the western
peaks and the village clock below them in the valley chimed out the three quarters after eleven as they walked down the road between blanched fields and sleeping houses On the edge of the village a few
lights still twinkled but the Pension Rosengl h demurely withdrawn behind its white palings showed a shuttered front to the moon Boyne opened the garden gate and started to go up the doorstep ahead
of Judith Oh you needn t ring Martin It would wake everybody I don t believe the door s locked I told Scopy to see that I wasn t shut out She tried the door knob which yielded hospitably and then
turned and flung her arms about her companion
Martin darling I don t believe I d ever have dared if I hadn t known you d see us through she declared with a resounding kiss
The devil you wouldn t he murmured but he pushed her gently in thinking I ought never to have given her that second cocktail From the threshold he whispered Go upstairs as quietly as you
can I ll be down in the morning to see how you re all getting on Then he shut the door on her and slipped out of the gate

efore mounting to Mrs Sellars s the next morning Boyne went down to the Pension Rosengl h to gather what farther details he could of the strange flight of the little Wheaters
As he reached the pension gate he was met by Miss Scope looking more than commonly gaunt and ravaged but as brightly resolute as her fellow conspirator Her gray cotton glove enfolded Boyne s
hand in an unflinching grasp and she exclaimed at once how providential it was that they should have caught him still at Cortina She added that she had been on the look out for him as both Judith and
Terry were still asleep and she was sure he d agree that they had better not be disturbed after all they d been through especially as Terry was still feverish The other children he gathered had already
breakfasted and been shepherded out by Nanny and the nursemaid to the downs above the valley and meanwhile perhaps Mr Boyne would come in and have a chat
The word seemed light for the heavy news he was prepared to hear but he suspected that Miss Scope like the Witch of Atlas was used to racing on the platforms of the wind and laughed to hear the
fire balls roar behind At any rate her sturdy composure restored his own balance and made him glad of the opportunity to hear her version of the adventure before his next encounter with Judith
Miss Scope was composed as she always was he was soon to learn in real emergencies She had been through so many that they seemed to her as natural and inevitable as thunder storms or chickenpox as troublesome but no more to be fussed about Nevertheless she did not underrate the gravity
of the situation to do so he suspected would have robbed it of its savour There had been cataclysms before times when Judy had threatened to go off and disappear with all the children but till now she
had never even attempted to put her threats into execution And now she s carried it off with a master hand Miss Scope declared in a tone of grim triumph
But carried it where to That was the question Boyne could not help putting He was sure Judith had been masterly but where was it all going to lead Had any of them taken that into account he asked
Well Miss Scope had to own that their departure had been too precipitate for much taking into account It had to be then or never she had seen that as clearly as Judy and Terry The fact that Terry
was with them showed how desperate the situation was Desperate Really desperate
Oh Mr Boyne If you d been through it twice before as my poor children have Listening to the details of her story he agreed that it must indeed have been awful and ended by
declaring that he did not question Judith s reasons but now that the first step in the mutiny was taken how did Miss Scope imagine that they were going to keep it up In short what did they mean to
do when they were found out
I think Judith counts very much on your intervention That s the reason she was so anxious to find you still here And of course she hopes there ll be time time to consider to choose a course of action
She believes it will be some days before we re found out as you put it I daresay she s told you that she left a letter Mr Boyne said Miss Scope interrupting herself with her sternest accent I hope you
don t think that in ordinary circumstances I should ever condone the least deceit The children will tell you that on that point I m inexorable But these were not ordinary circumstances She cleared her
throat and brought out Judith said in the letter that we d sailed for America She thinks her father will hurry there to find them and in that way we shall gain a little time for the steamer they re
supposed to be on is not due in New York for ten days
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
The plan seemed puerile even for so immature a mind as Judith s but Boyne did not raise that point He merely said I hope so But meanwhile what are you all going to live on It costs something
to feed such an army Miss Scope s countenance turned from sallow to white Her eyes forsook his face as they did when
she talked of Terry and she brought out hesitatingly Judith I understand has means Poor woman Boyne thought I believe she s plumped in all her savings I see he said He was
filled with a sudden loathing of all the wasteful luxury the vanity and selfishness and greed out of which this poor pale flower of compassion had sprung I see he repeated He stood up and held out
his hand You re their real mother If there s anything on earth I can do to the limit of my small capacity A tear ran down the furrows of Miss Scope s averted cheek He knew it by the hasty dab of
her cotton hand I know I know Oh Mr Boyne it s providential our finding you He pressed her wet glove hard and assured her that she could count on him He would go off now
he added to reflect further on the problem and come back later when Judy and Terry were awake
It was after eleven when he reached the ch let but luckily no long excursion had been planned for that morning Mrs Sellars had told him the night before that she had letters to write and should not
expect him early When he approached the little house in its clearing of emerald turf he saw her on the balcony her writing materials on a table at her elbow But she was leaning on the rail looking down
the path by which he always came He waved his hand and she answered with a welcoming gesture
Come up I m deep in papers she called down cheerily
I came last night but your lights were out and I was afraid of the cook he laughed taking her in his arms as she went to meet him The day was warm and she had put on a thin white dress which
gave her a springlike look Her complexion too had a morning freshness through which the blood ran up to his kiss But not afraid of me she questioned
Of you I like that You deserted me it s you who ought to be afraid I ve come to make a row you know
You ought to have come to thank me for my tact I saw you d run across old friends and slipped out of the way
I d run across one young friend Judith Wheater When I came back to tell you about it you d gone
Her eyes lit up with curiosity and interest Your famous little Judith Really Why you always speak of her as such a child I shouldn t have guessed
You said yourself last night how young she looked Yes awfully young but still grown up
Well she s not grown up She s a child a child tremendously to be pitied I want to tell you all about it I want your help and your advice You don t know what a quandary I m in
She had gone back to her seat on the balcony and he dropped into the chair beside her As he spoke her colour flickered up again and she smiled a little uncertainly A quandary about that child The
smile faded and her colour with it Martin you don t mean you can t He stared perplexed and then burst out laughing That the quandary s mine about little Judith
Bless you what an idea Why she s hardly out of the nursery He laughed again partly to bridge over his surprise and her constraint It was incredible what farfetched delusions the most sensible women
took up with at the very moment when one wanted them to look at a question like a man This is a very different business he went on Not in the least sentimental but merely squalid The Wheater
m nage has gone to smash again and Judy s bolted with all the children to try to prevent their being separated as they are whenever there s a new deal
Mrs Sellars sat looking at him with wide eyes and parted lips The situation was evidently too new to her to be at once intelligible and she repeated vaguely Bolted bolted from whom
From Joyce and Wheater Gone clean away without any warning
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She was again silent her eyes as it were fixed on this statement which seemed to carry her no
farther toward comprehension
But bolted with whom They can t have gone away all by themselves The governess is with them and the two nurses In a crisis like this they all stand by Judith I ve
just been talking with the governess and she entirely approves You see they ve been through this kind of thing before
Through the running away No but through what led up to it The last time it appears Judith told her parents that if they were
divorced again she meant to go off with all the children rather than have them separated from each other as they were before You see whenever a smash comes the children are divided up among the exparents and some of them are pretty rotten I imagine a blackmailing Italian prince a rather
notorious movie star and Lord knows who besides Not to speak of the new elements to be introduced if Joyce and Wheater both marry again as I ve no doubt they will in no time
Mrs Sellars her chin resting on her hand sat listening in a silence still visibly compounded of bewilderment and disgust For a minute after Boyne had ceased speaking she did not move or look up
At last she said in a low voice It s all too vile for belief Exactly he agreed And it s all true
The horrors those children must know about It s to save them from more horrors that Judith has carried them away
I see I see Poor child Her face melted into pity Just at first it was all too new to me But now I m beginning to understand And I suppose she came here hoping you would help her
I suppose she didn t have much time to think or choose but vaguely remembered I was here as her letter showed
But the money Where in the world did they get the money You can t transport a nursery full of children from one place to another without paying for it
Boyne hesitated a moment but he felt he must not betray Miss Scope and merely answered that he hadn t had time to go into all that yet but supposed that in an easy going extravagant household like
the Wheaters there were always some funds available the more so as preparations were already being made to send the children off to the mountains
Well it s all hideous and touching and crazy Where are the poor little things at your hotel Mrs
Sellars had gone indoors and was picking up her hat and sunshade I should like you to take me down at once to see them
Boyne was touched by the suggestion but secretly alarmed at what might happen if Mrs Sellars were exposed unprepared to the simultaneous assault of all the little Wheaters He explained that
Judith had taken her flock to an inexpensive pension in the village and that the younger children when he had called there were already away on the downs and Judith and Terry still sleeping off their
emotions Should he go down again he asked and bring Judith back alone to the ch let You d better see her first without the others You might find the seven of them rather overwhelming
Seven Mrs Sellars confessed she hadn t realised that there were actually seven She agreed that it would be perhaps better that she should first see Judith without her brothers and sisters and
proposed that Boyne should invite her to come back with him to the ch let to lunch If you think she won t be too frightened of a strange old woman The idea of Judith s being frightened of anything or
anybody amused Boyne but he thought it charming of Mrs Sellars to suggest it and was glad after all that she was there to support and advise him When she had had a quiet talk with Judith he felt sure
she would be on the children s side and perhaps her practical vision might penetrate farther than his into the riddle of what was to be done for them
If only he said to himself Judith doesn t begin by saying something that will startle her and he thought of warning Mrs Sellars not to expect a too great ingenuousness in his young friend Then he
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html reflected that such a warning might unconsciously prejudice her against the girl and decided that it
would be wiser to trust to Judith s natural charm to overcome anything odd in her conversation If there were hints to be given he concluded there would be less risk in giving them to Judith
But the utility of giving hints in that quarter became equally dubious at first sight of her Refreshed and radiant after her night s rest and unusually pretty in her light linen frock and a spreading hat
with a rosy lining Judith received him at the gate of the pension in an embrace which sent her hat flying among the currant bushes and exposed her rumpled head and laughing eyes to his close
inspection You look like a pansy this morning he said struck by the resemblance of her short pointed oval and velvet brown eyes to the eager inquisitive face of the mountain flower But Judith
was no gardener and rejected the comparison with a grimace How horrid of you Nasty wired things in wreaths at funerals I don t feel a bit as if I were at a funeral It s so jolly to be here and to have
found you You ve come to say you ll lunch with us haven t you The children will be mad with joy It was partly because I promised them we d find you here that they agreed to come Blanca and Zinnie
unsettled them at first they re always afraid of missing some excitement if they have a row with mother But I told them we d have lots more excitement with you She was hanging on his arm and
drawing him up the path to the house
I must tell the landlady you re coming to lunch Scopy s upstairs with Terry and she told me to be sure not to forget so that the cook could give us something extra By this time they were in the little
sitting room which smelt of varnish and dried edelweiss and had a stuffed eagle perched above the stove Judith sat down on the slippery sofa and dragged Boyne to a seat at her side And first I was to
ask you what pudding you d particularly like Oh bless you any pudding But about lunch
She drew herself up and tossed him an arch smile Or perhaps you re here incog with a lady and would rather not come I told Scopy I shouldn t wonder
Nonsense Judith how absurd Why absurd Why shouldn t you be here with a lady Vous tes encore tr s bien mon cher She
drew her deep lids half shut and slanted an insinuating glance at him
Don t talk like a manicure child As a matter of fact I have an old friend here who wants very much to see you and who kindly suggested
An old lady friend Yes
As old as Scopy No probably not as old as your mother even I only meant
But if she s younger than mother how can you say she s old Is she prettier too Judith broke in searchingly
I don t know really I haven t thought Well I don t believe she s as well dressed Unless perhaps you think Joyce s clothes are sometimes
just a shade too I haven t thought about that either What I mean by old is that Mrs Sellars and I have been friends
for years She s living in a ch let on the hill above the hotels and she wants me to bring you up to lunch with her today
Me only me Judith questioned visibly surprised
Boyne smiled Well my dear I m sure she would have liked to invite you all Chip included but her house is tiny and couldn t possibly take in the whole party So to avoid invidious distinctions why not
come by yourself and make her acquaintance I want you awfully to know her for no one can give you better advice than she can
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Judith drew herself up stiffly and her face became a blank I don t want anybody s advice but yours Martin But of course I ll go if you want me to
It s not a question of what I want But you may be sure if my advice is any good it will be because I ve consulted Mrs Sellars Two s not too many to get you out of this predicament I sometimes think
you don t realise what an awful row you re all in for If she s not as old as mother and you ve never noticed how she s dressed you must be in love with
her Judith went on as if his last words had not made the least impression on her
I don t see what difference it makes if I am or not he retorted beginning to lose his temper The point is that she happens to be one of the kindest and most sensible women I know
That s what men always think said Judith thoughtfully She drew back to study him again through half closed lids It s a wonderful thing to be in love she murmured and then continued with a
teasing smile Blanca s ever so much sharper than I am She said Why s Martin in such an awful hurry to rush away from Venice if he isn t slipping off on the quiet to meet a friend I suppose she
added with a fall in her voice and a corresponding droop of the lips it was awfully stupid of me to blunder in on you like this and you re racking your brains to think how you can get rid of us all and
keep out of a row with father and mother Boyne half exasperated and half touched as he so often was in his talks with her and especially
when he knew she wished to give him pain laid his hand reproachfully on hers Look here Judith I could shake you when you talk such drivel The only thing I m racking my brains about is how to help
you to get what you want To keep you all together as you are now and yet not let your father and mother think that I ve had anything to do with this performance You re quite right I do want to stay
on good terms with them because if I do I may succeed in persuading them that whatever happens they ve no right to separate you children again If I do that I shall have done my best for you But I
don t see my way to it yet and that s why I want you to come and make friends with Mrs Sellars To his surprise she listened in an attentive silence and when he had ended lifted to his the face of
an obedient child Of course I ll do what you want Martin But don t you think your friend would perhaps understand better if I had Nanny bring up Chip to see her after lunch
Bless you of course she would he agreed enthusiastically and she thereupon proposed that before they started he should come upstairs and see Terry

eeing Terry Boyne had to admit was the surest way of attaching one body and soul to the cause of the little Wheaters Whatever Mrs Sellars thought of Judith a question of obvious uncertainty
there could be no doubt as to what she would think of Terry
There had been moments during the morning when Boyne did not see how any good will on either part could bridge the distance between Mrs Sellars s conception of life and Judith Wheater s
experience of it but between Mrs Sellars and Terry there would be nothing to explain or bridge over
Their minds would meet as soon as their eyes did I ll bring her down to see him after lunch Boyne decided
There was no hope of Terry s being up that day The excitement of the flight and the heat and fatigue of the journey had used up his small surplus of strength and he could only lie staring at Boyne
with eager eyes and protest that he knew the air of Cortina would put him all right before long Scopy had already had the doctor in and administered suitable remedies and the patient s temperature had
dropped to nearly normal If only father and mother will let us stay here I m sure I shall be patched up this time And you ll be here for a bit to look after the children won t you Martin
Boyne said he would stay as long as he could and at any rate not leave till the little Wheaters difficulty with their parents was on the way to adjustment He pointed out that negotiations would no
doubt be necessary and Terry promptly rejoined That s just why Judy and I decided to come here
We knew that if we could get hold of you you d back us up and help us to make some kind of terms with father and mother His eyes fixed his friend s with a passionate insistence You see Martin it
won t do separating us again it really won t We re not going to get any sort of education at this rate
And as for manners The children have all been completely demoralised since Zinnia s visit Now they ve heard of Buondelmonte s marriage and the steps have gone off their base too and as for
Blanca she thinks of nothing but dressing up and flirtation As soon as things go wrong between father and mother the children seem to feel it in the air even before the actual fighting begins they all
get out of hand Zinnie gave Bun a black eye the other day because he said he was going to be a Prince again and live in his father s palace in Rome and have his own Rolls a child who hardly knows his
letters Terry concluded with a gesture of contempt
I know old man It s all wrong Boyne agreed and something s got to be done and done soon
That s what I m going to try to make your father and mother see Meanwhile you must make the most of this respite to get a good rest I promise I ll do what I can when the time comes
Oh you needn t promise Terry said letting his head sink back contentedly on the pillows
On the way up the hill with Judith Boyne was able to gather some of the details she had been too tired and excited to impart the night before Miss Scope s confidences were always in the nature of
sombre generalizations When it came to particulars she retreated behind professional secrecy and Boyne had not liked to force her defences Besides he knew that no such scruples would hamper
Judith who saw life only in particulars But after all there was nothing very unexpected in Judith s story As she said it was always the same old row over again As soon as Zinnia Lacrosse had cast a
covetous eye on Gerald Ormerod Joyce had decided that she could not live without him The thought of his dining every night at the Lido with the Wrenches and the Duke of Mendip while she and
Wheater sat alone on the deck of the Fancy Girl or made the most of such mediocre guests as they could collect was too much for a high spirited woman and Joyce had suddenly requested her husband
to sack the tutor Wheater surprised had protested that Terry liked him and Terry did he was very
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
jolly and a good teacher Judith impartially admitted whereupon Joyce had declared that if Ormerod wasn t sent away at once she intended to divorce Wheater and marry him Wheater of course was
furious and there had been in Judith s language an all round circus complicated by the fact that what Gerald really wanted was to marry her
What what Marry you Have you all of you gone crazy Boyne found himself indignantly repeating
Judith smiled I m not crazy And I m nearly sixteen And I suppose I m a nairess She pronounced the word as she wrote it But you don t imagine I d leave the children do you Besides
Terry says it would be ridiculous to marry till I can learn how to spell My God I should say it would cried Boyne furiously What on earth would come of it he asked
himself if she opened the conversation with Mrs Sellars on this note Judith look here But I don t know after all she went on in a reflective tone Gerald says some of the greatest
people never could spell Napoleon couldn t or Madame de S vign and Shakespeare signed his name differently every time
I see you ve taken a course in history since I left Boyne sneered to which she responded with simplicity No but he told me that one day when he found me crying because of my awful spelling
Well you re quite right to cry about your spelling And Terry s quite right to say that the first thing you want is to have some sort of an education all of you
Perhaps then it would have been better for me to marry Gerald she rejoined with a return of her uncanny impartiality But no she interrupted herself I never could have kept the children if I had
so what s the use Well here we are Boyne broke in nervously
Why you poor child how young you are after all Mrs Sellars exclaimed swaying forward to drop an impulsive kiss on Judith s cheek Boyne s first thought was how young she looked herself in her
thin black dress her auburn head bent like an elder sister s above Judith s then how much too young Judith was to be conciliated by that form of greeting
Judith looked at her hostess with a smile Young for what she asked with an ominous simplicity
Why for all your responsibilities the other answered checked in her premeditated spontaneity
Judith was still smiling a small quiet smile from which the watchful Boyne augured no good
I suppose I ought to be flattered she said I know that at your age and mother s it s thought awfully flattering to be called young But you see I m not sixteen yet so it s nothing extraordinary to
me Your being so young makes it extraordinarily kind of you to come and see an old lady like me Mrs
Sellars smiled back taking nervous refuge in platitudes
Judith considered her with calm velvety eyes Oh but I wanted to come Martin says you ll be a friend and we need friends badly
Mrs Sellars s eyes at once softened Martin s quite right I ll be as good a friend as you ll let me I m so glad you ve come to share my picnic lunch And Martin will have told you how sorry I was not to
have room for the whole party in this tiny house Well said Judith he thought you d find us rather overwhelming but Mrs Sellars laughed this
away as an unauthorized impertinence of her old friend s
On the whole things were beginning better than the old friend had expected He only hoped Rose wouldn t mind Judith s chucking down her hat on the sitting room sofa and turning to the glass above
the mantelpiece to run her fingers through her tossed hair Once at table Mrs Sellars led the talk to the subject of the little Wheaters whose names she had cleverly managed to master and whose

acquaintance she expressed the wish to make at the earliest opportunity steps and all For I assure you she added I m not as easily overwhelmed as Martin seems to think
Judith was always at her best when she was talking of the children and especially of Terry whose name Mrs Sellars had spoken with a sympathy which brought a glow to the girl s cheek Oh Terry s
far and away the best of us you ll love Terry If only he could have half a chance I don t mean about his health father and mother have really done all they could about that But he s never had any proper
education and he isn t strong enough yet to go to school She went on forgetting herself and her habit of being on the defensive carried away by the need to explain Terry to put him in the handsomest
possible light before this friend of Martin s who was so evidently a person of standards and principles like Terry himself It was just another bit of poor Terry s bad luck she pursued for ever so long he d
been begging and imploring their parents to let him have a good tutor like other boys of his age who weren t strong enough for school and finally they had understood and agreed that he couldn t be left
any longer to Scopy and the nurses and then when the tutor was finally found and everything working so well Joyce had to take it into her head to marry him Didn t Mrs Sellars agree that it was a
particularly rotten piece of luck
Yes Mrs Sellars did agree Only Boyne saw from the curve of her lips luck was not precisely the noun she would have used nor rotten the adjective
But surely it s just a passing whim of of your mother s When it comes to the point she won t break up everything in order to marry this young man
Judith s eyes widened Well what can mother do if she s in love with him Mrs Sellars lowered her lids softly as if she were closing the eyes of a dead self Why she could
she could think of all of you my dear Oh she ll do that Judith rejoined She has already She and father are fighting over us now
That s why we bolted Hasn t Martin told you I think Martin felt he d rather have you tell me about it yourself that is as much as you care to
said Mrs Sellars with tactful evasiveness
Judith pondered her brows gathering in a puzzled frown I don t know that there s anything more to tell I brought the children away so that we shouldn t be separated again If children don t look after
each other who s going to do it for them You can t expect parents to when they don t know how to look after themselves
Ah my dear murmured Mrs Sellars With an impulsive movement she put her hand on Judith s
Just say that to your mother as you ve said it to me and she ll never give you up for anybody Judith s frown relaxed and her eyebrows ran up incredulously She has before you know What are
you to do when you fall in love That s one thing I never mean to do she announced in a decisive tone Besides you know she went on one does get used to children I suppose you ve never had
any have you Mrs Sellars made a faint sign of negation Oh well Judith continued encouragingly I daresay it s not too late But if you d had all of us on your hands and the three steps besides you d
probably take us for granted by this time Not that mother isn t fond of us only she has these heartstorms That s what poor Doll Westway used to call them And she knew Mrs Sellars laid down the spoon with which she was absently stirring her coffee Doll Westway
Judith s face lit up You knew her No said Mrs Sellars in a tone of rejection acutely familiar to Boyne but obviously unremarked by
She was my very best friend Judith went on You never saw anybody so lovely to look at In tea rose bathing tights
My dear Mrs Sellars interrupted don t you think it seems a pity to sit indoors in such weather
If you ve finished your coffee shall we move out on the balcony Martin do find the cigarettes Her
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
sweetness suffused them like a silvery icing Judith obviously puzzled rose to follow her and Boyne distributed cigarettes with a savage energy Oh damn it what had gone wrong again now
But whatever had gone wrong was for the moment at any rate set right by the appearance of a blueveiled nurse who was conducting a rosy little boy up the slope beneath the balcony Hullo This way here I am Judith joyously signalled to the pair and Mrs Sellars leaning over the railing at her side
instantly declared Here s somebody too beautiful not to be the celebrated Chip Yes it was clever of Judith to have arranged that Chipstone should appear at that moment To a
childless woman the sight of that armful of health and good humour must be at once a pang and a balm Mrs Sellars s eyes met Boyne s smiling trembling and his signalled back Damn Aunt Julia
Chipstone had already filled the air with his immovable serenity They had gone back into the sittingroom to greet him and he settled himself Buddha like on Mrs Sellars s knee and laughed with satisfaction at the sight of Judy and Martin and Nanny grouped admiringly before him Whatever
came Chip s way seemed to turn into something as fresh as new milk with the bubbles on it
Oh Chip s a good enough fellow said Judith fondly disparaging But wait till you see Terry Terry couldn t come but the rest of us have announced a sharp little voice outside the door
Good gracious If it isn t Zinnie Judith jumped up in a rush of indignation but before she could reach the door it had opened on the self possessed figure of her little step sister behind whose fiery
mop appeared the dark bobbing heads of Bun and Beechy
Well if ever I never did Susan swore to me she d never let em out of her sight while we was away Nanny ejaculated paling under Judith s wrathful glance
She never did neither said Zinnie composedly She watched us almost all the way but we could run faster than her cos she s got a shoe t hurts her n so after a while she had to give up chasing us
Didn t she This was flung back to the steps for corroboration
But a masterly somersault had already introduced Bun to the centre front where he remained head down bare legs and sandal soles in air and Beechy had rushed up to Mrs Sellars and flung her
passionate arms about Chipstone Oh my Cheepo we thought we d losted you and you were dead she joyfully wailed and Chip received her p an with a rosy grin
Yes n Judy hadn t ought to of sneaked away and left us all like that n not said anything bout coming here but only ranged for Chip to come and see you when he s the youngest of the bunch
ought she of Zinnie appealed indignantly to Mrs Sellars who replied that it evidently didn t seem fair but she must take the blame to herself for living in such a small house that she hadn t been able to
invite them all to lunch because the dining room wouldn t have held them And I suppose she concluded diplomatically Chipstone was chosen to represent you because he takes up the least
room No he doesn t either I do shouted Bun swiftly reversing himself and facing Mrs Sellars in a
challenging attitude I can crawl through a croky hoop and I can You can t hold your tongue and Chip can and that s why I brought him and not the rest of you
cried Judith administering a shake to Bun while Nanny seized upon Beechy to stifle her incipient howl of sympathy
Oh these dreadful children It was another voice at the door this time so discreetly pitched so sweetly deprecating that Mrs Sellars instinctively rose to receive a visitor who seemed as little used as
herself to noisy company
I am so sorry Blanca was in the room now slim white frocked imperturbable with an air of mundane maturity which made Judith seem like her younger sister
Poor Susan told me they d run away from her when they found Nanny was coming here with Chip and I rushed after them but couldn t catch them I m sorry but it wasn t my fault Prettily breathless
she excused herself to Judith but her long lashes were busy drawing Mrs Sellars and Boyne into their
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html net Darling Martin She bestowed on him one of her mother s most studied intonations I m Terry s
twin she explained to Mrs Sellars
The latter at ease with graces so like her own replied with a smile that since Terry could not come she appreciated his sending such a charming delegate Judith shot a grimace at Boyne but Blanca
with a sudden rush of sincerity declared Oh but when you ve seen Terry you won t care for any of the rest of us
Yes she will she ll care for Beechy and me because we re Roman Princes Bun shouted threatening another handspring which a gesture from Judith curtailed
Zinnie pushed him aside and planted herself firmly in front of their hostess My mother could buy em all out if she wanted to cos she s a movie star she affirmed in her thin penetrating voice But I d
never let her cos we all love each other very much n Judy s made us all swear on Scopy s book we d stay together till we got married I m probably going to marry Bun
At this announcement signs of damp despair revealed themselves on Beechy s features but Bun regardless of the emotions he excited interposed to say My real mother was a lion tamer but that
don t matter cos she s dead Mrs Sellars had risen to the occasion on one of her quick wing beats Games tea and more games
had been improvised with the promptness and skill which always distinguished her in social emergencies and the afternoon was nearly over when a band of replete and sleepy children took their
way home to the Pension Rosengl h On the threshold of the ch let Zinnie paused to call up to the balcony I s pose f you d known we were coming you d have had some presents ready for us A cuff
from Judith nipped the suggestion and the flock was hurried off down the hill but not too quickly to catch Mrs Sellars s response Come up to morrow and you ll see
Mrs Sellars however did not wait till the next day to return the little Wheaters visit Soon after their departure she gathered up an armful of books selected for Terry s special delectation and walked
down to the pension with Boyne The younger children were by this time at supper but the visitor was introduced to Miss Scope and conducted by her to Terry s bedside Neither Judith nor Boyne
accompanied her since the doctor did not want his patient to see many people till he had recovered from his fatigue Mrs Sellars for this reason remained only for a few minutes with the little boy and
when she rejoined Boyne who was waiting for her at the gate she said simply I m glad I came Boyne liked her for knowing that he would guess the rest He had never had any doubts about this
When he got back to his hotel he found the telegram which he had been expecting since the morning For God s sake wire at once if children with you and Chipstone all right worried to death
cannot understand insane performance police traced them to Padua where they hired motors for Botzen please ship them all back immediately will wire you funds Wheater
Damn it well I ll have to go and see him myself Boyne muttered crumpling up the paper and jamming it into his pocket The message had shattered his dream paradise of a day and now the
sooner the business ahead of him was over the better for everybody But with a certain satisfaction he concluded after a glance at the clock Too late to wire tonight anyhow

ere how was I to answer this Boyne challenged Mrs Sellars that evening pushing the telegram across the dinner table where they had lingered over their wood strawberries and
She had been charming about the Wheater children after their departure appreciative of Judith with a shade of reserve discerning and tender about Terry and warmly motherly about the others It
was heart breaking the whole business and so touching the way they all turned to Martin for help regarding him apparently as their only friend how well she understood that But what on
earth was he going to do about it What possible issue did he see
All through dinner they went in and out of the question till Boyne feeling that thanks to Terry her sympathy was permanently secured drew the Wheater telegram from his pocket Mrs Sellars
scrutinised it thoughtfully
When did this come Just now I found it when I went back to the hotel
She sighed Of course the Wheaters were bound to find out within twenty four hours where they d gone Poor little conspirators I wish we could have kept them a day or two longer especially with
that boy so overdone Well perhaps we can
Her eyebrows queried How But instead of taking this up he said You haven t told me yet what I m to answer
Her mobile brow sketched another query What can you answer Their father ll come and fetch them if you don t send them back
I certainly shan t do that Shan t Then what Her eyes darkened and she took up the telegram and studied it again then
she lifted a faintly mocking smile to Boyne I confess I m curious to hear your alternative He considered this with a frown of perplexity Why should I answer at all
If you don t Wheater has only to telephone to your hotel and find out if you re still here and if you ve been seen about with a party of children
I shan t be here I ll pack off at once to Pieve di Cadore or somewhere And the children
I ll take them with me Are you serious
Absolutely She received this with a little silken laugh Then you re a child yourself dear How long do you
suppose it will be before you re run down You ll only be making things worse for the children and for yourself
Hang myself But for them He frowned and pondered again Well damn it perhaps But what have you got to suggest
That you should persuade Judith to take them straight back of course I m awfully sorry for them all and Terry especially But as far as I can see there s nothing else to do
He stood up and began to pace the floor I ll never do that
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
She leaned her white arms on the table and her smile followed his impatient pacings Then what I don t know Not yet Anyhow I ve got the night to think it over
All the thinking in the world won t get you any farther He met her smile with a grin which was almost antagonistic I ve got out of one or two tighter places
in my life before now I ve no doubt you have she returned in her tone of slightly humorous admiration
There they had dropped the discussion both too experienced in debate not to feel its uselessness
And the next morning had after all told Boyne without any one s help what he intended to do He decided that his first step was to see Judith and he was down at the pension before the shutters of her
room were unlatched Miss Scope was summoned to the sitting room and he told her that Judith must come down immediately to see him
Bad news Mr Boyne oh I hope not Well you didn t seriously suppose it was going to take Wheater much longer than this to run you
down did you Miss Scope whitened Are the police after us
The police He burst out laughing To arrest you for abduction If they do it shall be over my dead body
She turned to go and then paused to face him from the threshold Whatever Judith did was done with my knowledge and consent consent I don t say approval she declared in an emphatic whisper
Of course of course But send her down at once will you please A moment later Judith was there huddled into a scant poppy coloured dressing gown her hair
tumbling thickly over childish eyes still misty with sleep What is it Martin The police He laughed again this time more impatiently Don t be ridiculous child You re as bad as Scopy
You didn t really believe your father would have you arrested did you She met this with another question What is he going to do
Boyne handed her the telegram and she flashed back You haven t answered it Not yet
Well we ll have to start at once I suppose Boyne stared at her so unprepared for this prompt abdication that the feeling uppermost in him was
a sudden sense of flatness He had come there ready to put up a fight valiant if unresourceful and now
Couldn t we catch a steamer at Trieste she continued apparently pursuing some inward train of thought The unexpected question jerked him back out of his supineness
Trieste Why Trieste He stared at her puzzled Where to Oh almost anywhere where they can t reach us too quickly As if unconscious of his presence she
continued to brood upon her problem Perhaps do you know after all we d better go to America
Don t you think so There s Grandma Mervin Joyce s mother We might go to her And meanwhile you can make the Wheaters think we re still here and so they won t be worried and we shall have time
to slip away In spite of himself Boyne s first feeling was one of relief that she meant to keep up the struggle To
begin with it was more like her and he had reached the point of wanting her at all costs to be like herself But he kept his wits sufficiently to reply on a note of sarcasm Thank you for the part for
which I m cast But my poor child even if you could get away to America without your parents knowing it such journeys cost money and I don t suppose
Oh I ve oceans of money she answered with a startling composure
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
What do you call oceans of money Scopy s savings he taunted her
Judith flushed up She told you She told me nothing I guessed
Her head drooped for a moment then she raised it with a confident smile Well of course I shall pay her back She s sure of that She knows I m a nairess
Heroic woman But how far do you expect to go on what she s contributed This also Judith faced with composure Not very poor dear Scopy But you see I ve got a lot
besides A lot of money
She leaned her rumpled head back against the hard sofa apparently determined to enjoy his bewilderment for a moment longer before enlightening him Don t you call five thousand dollars a lot
of money she asked
Boyne gave a whistle of astonishment and she nodded softly in corroboration
You had five thousand dollars of your own No But I knew where father had them
Boyne jumped to his feet and stood glaring down at her incredulously You knew Don t gape at me Martin If you like to call it so I stole the money He always has a lot about
because it bores him so to write cheques And you helped yourself to what you wanted
It was awfully easy I knew where the key was She seemed anxious to disclaim any undeserved credit in the matter And anyhow I knew part of it was intended for our expenses in the Engadine
this summer So it really wasn t exactly like stealing was it Boyne sat down again this time in a chair on the farther side of the room There seemed to be
something almost maleficent in the proximity of the small scarlet figure with rumpled hair and sleepmisted eyes curled up defiantly in the sofa corner You told your father this I suppose in the letter you left for him
Told him I d taken the money She laughed If I had there wouldn t have been much use in taking it would there
He groaned and sat silent his eyes fixed on the carefully scrubbed boards of the floor For a while he concentrated his whole attention on one of their resinous knots then with limbs of lead he slowly
stood up again Well I wash my hands of you all of you Judith rose also and went quickly up to him Martin she said in a frightened voice what are you
going to do Do Nothing You d better answer that telegram yourself he retorted roughly shaking off the hand
she had put out He walked across the room blinked unseeingly at his hat and stick which he had thrown down on the table and turned to go out of the door without remembering to pick them up On
the threshold he was checked by Judith s passionate clutch on his arm Her lifted face was wet and frightened Martin why don t you say you think I m a thief and have done with it
He swung round on her I think you re an unutterable fool I think the average Andaman islander has a more highly developed moral sense than you
I don t know who they are But Doll Westway always used to Used to what
Go to her mother s drawer There wasn t any other way They all hate the bother of paying bills parents do She clung to him her lips still trembling
Miss Scope knows about this I suppose
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She nodded I persuaded her She hated it awfully but she saw there was no other way She s saved
so little herself because she has a brother who drinks And Terry Does Terry know
Oh Martin Terry How could you think it But you don t really do you You just said that to frighten me Oh Martin you ll never tell Terry will you I shall die if you do It doesn t matter about
anybody else He stood silent suffering her clasp of desperate entreaty as if a numbness had crept into the arm
she held and yet as if every nerve in it were fire Something of the same duality was in his brain as he listened It struck him dumb with the sense of his incapacity All the forces of pity and of something
closer to the soul than pity were fighting in him for her But opposed to them was the old habit of relentless unconditional probity the working man s faith in a standard to be kept up and imposed on
others at no matter what cost of individual suffering I can t let her drift was as near as he could come to it
Martin tell me what you want me to do she whispered her lips trembling His own hardened
Sit down at that table and write to your father that you took the money and why you took it For a while she considered this painfully If I don t she finally brought out shall you tell Terry
He gave her an indignant look Of course I shan t tell Terry Very well Then I will
Boyne flushed with the suddenness of his triumph and most of all at the reason for it That s my Judy
She coloured too as if surprised but her face remained drawn and joyless But if I do the game s up isn t it
The game s up anyhow my dear Her colour faded You mean you re really going to give us away
He paused and then said with deliberation I m going to Venice at once to see your father To tell him we re here
Of course Her hand fell from his arm and she stood drooping before him all the youth drained out of her face
He was frightened at the effect of his words Her boundless capacity for suffering struck him as the strangest element in her tragic plight
Then you give us up altogether You don t care any longer what becomes of us He paused a moment and then turned back into the room and took her two cold hands in his
Judith look at me She obeyed
Can t you understand that I care for only one thing at this moment That you should realise what you ve done
About the money she breathed
Of course About the money You really think that matters more than anything else
The unexpectedness of the question suddenly cut him adrift from his argument It seemed to come out of some other plane of experience to be thrust at him from depths of pain and disillusionment that
he had not yet begun to sound
You see she pressed on snatching at her opportunity if we could only get to Grandma Mervin s I believe she d keep us At any rate she d try to make mother see that we mustn t be separated I know
she would because in her letters to mother she always calls us those poor children She s awfully oldfashioned Grandma Mervin And the money Martin father won t find out for ever so long that it s gone There was a lot more where I took it from He always has such heaps with him and he never
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
knows how much he s spent Once he had a valet who stole a lot and he didn t discover it for months
And without that money we can t possibly get to America Boyne pulled himself together with an effort averting his eyes from the perilous mirage And you re
gambling on being as lucky as the other thief There saying that had cleared his conscience and he could go on more humanely Don t you see child that this business of the money spoils the whole
thing You ve got to give it back to me and I ve got to take it to your father Then I ll put up the best fight I can for you
Of this appeal she seemed to hear only the last words You will oh Martin darling you really will
In an instant her arms were about his neck her wet face pressed against his lips Now now
now he grumbled I knew it Martin I knew in my soul you d never chuck us she exulted in the sudden ecstasy of her relief Waves of buoyancy seemed to be springing beneath her feet Martin I
know you ll know just what to say to them she chanted
Go upstairs Judith and get that money he admonished her severely
She turned and left the room While she was gone he stood gazing out of the window Of all the world of light and freedom before him its spreading mountain slopes its spires of granite reared into
a cloud pillared sky and the giant blue shadows racing each other across the valleys he saw nothing but the narrow thread of railway winding down to Venice and the Wheaters He had still to make
Judith write the letter to her father He had still to deliver her this child who trusted him bound and helpless into the hands of the enemy

amn damn damn oh damn It seemed to be the only expletive at Cliffe Wheater s command and Boyne felt that he had used it so often that it was as worn out as an old elastic
band and no longer held his scattered ideas together
He plunged down into an armchair of the Lido Palace lounge the Wheaters had moved out to the Lido and sat there embraced by a cluster of huge leather bolsters his good humoured lips tinged
with an uneasy purple the veins in his blond temples swollen with a helpless exasperation Damn he ejaculated again
The place was empty It was the hour of the afternoon sun bath on the sands below the hotel and no one shared with them the cool twilight of the hall but a knot of white jacketed boys languishing near
the lift and a gold braided porter dozing behind his desk
Boyne sat opposite to Wheater in another vast slippery armchair to which only a continual muscular effort could anchor his spare frame He sat and watched Cliffe Wheater with the narrow lipped
attention he might have given to the last stages of a debate with a native potentate on whom he was trying to impose some big engineering scheme which would necessitate crossing the ruler s territory
But with the potentate it would have been only a question of matching values of convincing him of the material worth of what was offered In such negotiations the language spoken when interpreted
usually turned out to be the same But in his talk with Wheater Boyne had the sense of using an idiom for which the other had no equivalents Superficially their vocabularies were the same below the
surface each lost its meaning for the other Wheater continued to toss uneasily on a sea of incomprehension
What in hell can I do about it he demanded
It was almost unintelligible that anything should have happened to him against which his wealth and his health could not prevail His first idea seemed to be that it must be all a mistake or somebody
else s damned negligence As if they had forgotten to set the burglar alarm or to order the motor or to pay the fire insurance or to choke off a bore at the telephone or by some other unstopped fissure in
the tight armour of his wellbeing had suddenly let tribulation in on him If he could get at the offender if he only could But it was the crux of his misery that apparently he couldn t
Not that I blame the child he said suddenly looking down with an interrogative stare at his heavy blond haired hands with their glossy nails and one broad gold ring with an uncut sapphire He raised
his eyes and examined Boyne who instantly felt himself leaping to the guard of his own face
That business of the money you understand Judith didn t in the least realise Boyne began
Oh damn the money That question was swept away with a brush of the hand Boyne had noticed that the poor little letter of confession he had extracted from Judith had received hardly a glance from
her father who had pocketed the bank notes as carelessly as if they were a gambling debt Evidently the Lido Palace values were different It was the hideous inconvenience of it all that was gnawing at
Wheater and also to be fair to him a vague muddled distress about his children I didn t know the poor little chaps cared so much was all this emotion wrung from him none the less Boyne felt it was
They care most awfully for each other and very much for you and Joyce What they need beyond everything is a home a home with you two at its head
Oh damn Wheater groaned again It was as if Boyne had proposed to him to ascend the throne of England What was the use of dealing in impossibles There were things which even his money
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html couldn t buy and when you stripped him of the sense of its omnipotence he squirmed like a snail out
Why can t there not be rows he began again perspiring with the oppression of his helplessness
There wouldn t be if you and Joyce would only come to an understanding The aggrieved husband met this derisively Joyce and an understanding
Well she s awfully fond of the children and so are you And they re devoted to both of you all of them Why can t you and she agree to bury your differences and arrange your lives so that you can
keep the children together and give them something that looks like a home while you both well do whatever you like privately Boyne felt his lips drying as they framed this arid proposal
Wheater leaned his elbows on his knees and gazed at the picture presented Joyce doesn t care to do what she likes privately he replied without irony
But the children I m sure she doesn t want to part with them No and no more do I And what s more I won t He brought down a clenched fist on the leather
protuberance at his elbow It sank in soggily as if the Lido armchair had been the symbol of Joyce s sullen opposition By God I can dictate my terms Wheater pursued sonorously but without
Boyne stood up with a sense of weariness His bones felt as stiff as if he had been trying to hang on to a jagged rock above a precipice his mind participated in their ache
Look here Cliffe what s the use of threats Of course you re all powerful Between you Joyce and you can easily destroy these children s lives
Oh see here Wheater protested
Destroy their lives Look at that poor Doll Westway who was kicked about from pillar to post
Judith told me her miserable story I don t see the resemblance And what s more I strongly object to being classed with a down and
outer like Charlie Westway Why man no law court in the world would have given a blackguard like that the custody of his children Whereas mine will always be perfectly safe in my hands and Joyce
knows it and so do her lawyers I daresay but the trouble is that the children need Joyce at least as much as they do you And they
need something that neither one of you can give them separately They need you and Joyce together
that s what a home is made of togetherness the mysterious atmosphere Boyne broke off nervously swallowing his own eloquence
Wheater gave him a helpless look Have a drink he suggested He waved his hand to the whitecoated guardians of the lift Far off across the empty reaches of the hall a waiter appeared with napkin and tray sail and raft of a desert ocean Hi Wheater called out feverishly Boyne wondered that he
did not brandish his handkerchief at the end of a stick The two men drank in a desperate silence
Capturing Joyce s attention was less easy It was difficult even to secure her presence Not that she avoided her husband on the contrary she devoted all the time she could spare to arguing with him
about their future arrangements And she had flung herself on Boyne in an agony of apprehension about the children But once assured of their safety she remarked that their going off like that had
served Cliffe right and she hoped it would be a lesson to him and thereupon hurried away to a pressing engagement on the beach promising Boyne to see him when she came up to dress for dinner
anywhere between eight and nine She supposed Cliffe would look after him in the interval
It was nearer nine than eight when Boyne finally waylaid her in an upper corridor on the way back to her room She relegated him to her sitting room while she got out of her bathing tights and
presently reappeared swathed in perfumed draperies with vivid eyes tossed hair as young as Judith s and the animating glow imparted by a new love affair Boyne remembered Terry s phrase With all

the new ways the doctors have of making parents young again and reflected that this oldest one of all was still the most effective She threw herself down on a lounge clasped her arms behind her head
and declared It was too clever of Judith to give her father that scare Now perhaps he ll come to his senses Yes Boyne thought she was going to be more difficult to convince than Wheater
What do you call coming to his senses Why giving all the children to me of course to me and Gerald Her lids closed softly on the
name Boyne was frightened by a reminder of Judith s way of caressing certain thoughts and images with her lashes He hated anything in the mother that recalled what he most loved in her daughter
The trouble is Joyce that what they want what they need is not you and and anybody else
but just you and Cliffe their parents Me and Cliffe An edifying spectacle
Oh well they ve discounted all that at least Judith and Terry have And they re incurably fond of you both What the younger ones require of course is just the even warmth of a home like any other
young animals She considered her shining nails as if glassing her indolent beauty in them
You see Boyne pressed on it s all these changes of temperature that are killing them What changes of temperature
Well every time there s a new deal I mean a new step parent there s necessarily a new atmosphere isn t there Young things you know need sameness it s their vital element
Joyce at this point surprised him by abounding in his own sense It was never she who wanted to change she assured him Hadn t she come back of her own accord to Cliffe and loyally made the
attempt all over again just on account of the children And what had been the result as far as they were concerned Simply their being compelled to assist with older and more enlightened eyes at the
same old rows and scandals for Cliffe was scandalous which had already edified their infancy Could Boyne possibly advise the renewal of such conditions as a vital element in their welfare the poor
darlings It would be the most disastrous experiment that could be made with them Whereas if they would just firmly declare their determination to remain with Joyce and only with Joyce Cliffe would
soon come to his senses and anyhow as soon as another woman got hold of him he wouldn t know what to do with the children and would be only too thankful to know they were in safe hands And had
Boyne considered what a boon it would be to dear Terry to have Gerald always with him not as a salaried tutor but better still as friend companion guardian as everything his own father had failed
to be Boyne must have seen what a fancy Terry had taken to Gerald And Gerald simply loved the boy
That consideration Joyce owned had influenced her not a little in her determination to break with Wheater
Joyce was much more articulate than her husband and paradoxical as it seemed proportionately harder to deal with She swept away all Boyne s arguments on a torrent of sentimental verbiage and
she had the immense advantage over Wheater of believing that the children would be perfectly happy with her whereas Wheater merely believed in his right to keep them whether his doing so made them
But these considerations were interrupted by Joyce s abrupt exclamation that it was past nine already and the Wrenches and the Duke of Mendip were waiting for her of course dear Martin
would join them at dinner No Martin thought he wouldn t thanks in fact he d already promised Cliffe
But Cliffe s coming too Oh you didn t know My dear he s infatuated with Sybil Lullmer She came here to try and catch Mendip and failing that she s quietly annexed Cliffe instead Rather funny
isn t it But of course that kind of woman sticks at nothing With her record why should she And Cliffe has had to make up with Zinnia Wrench because it was the easiest way of being with Sybil So

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html you will dine with us Martin won t you And do tell me you re sure Chip s perfectly contented And
you think Cortina will do Terry good Half an hour later Boyne who had sternly told himself that this also was part of the game sat at a
table in the crowded Lido Palace restaurant overhanging the starlit whisper of the Adriatic His seat was between Zinnia Lacrosse and Joyce Wheater and opposite him was a small sleek creature who
reminded him when she first entered of Judith who had the same puzzled craving eyes the same soft shadowy look amid the surrounding glare But when he faced her across the table saw her smile
heard her voice he was furious with himself for the comparison
Do you mean to say you don t know Syb Lullmer Joyce whispered to him under cover of the saxophones But you must have heard of her as Mrs Charlie Westway She always manages to be in
the spot light Her daughter Doll committed suicide last year at Deauville It was all pretty beastly Syb herself is always chock full of drugs Doesn t look it does she She might be Judy s age in this light
What do you think of her I think she s hideous
Mrs Wheater stared Well the dress makers don t They dress her for nothing Look at her ogling Gerald That s what makes Cliffe so frantic Cliffe s wife smilingly noted After a moment she added
A nice step mother for my children Do you wonder I m putting up a fight to keep them From across the table Mrs Lullmer was speaking in a low piercing whine When she spoke her large
eyes became as empty as a medium s and her lips moved just enough to let out a flat knife edge of voice I told Anastase I d never speak to him again or set foot in his place if ever I caught him selling
one of the dresses he d designed for me to a respectable woman and he said Why I never saw one in my establishment did you And I said to him Now you ve insulted me and I ll sue you for libel if you
don t take fifty per cent off my bill I m poor you see Mrs Lullmer concluded plaintively sweeping the table with her disarming gaze The Duke Zinnia Lord Wrench and Cliffe Wheater received the
anecdote with uproarious approval Gerald Ormerod looked at the ceiling and Joyce looked tenderly at Gerald I got off twenty five per cent anyhow Mrs Lullmer whined spreading her fluid gaze over
All about them at other tables exactly like theirs sat other men exactly like Lord Wrench and Wheater the Duke of Mendip and Gerald Ormerod other women exactly like Joyce and Zinnia and
Mrs Lullmer Boyne remembered Mrs Sellars s wail at the approach of a standardised beauty Here it was in all its mechanical terror endless and meaningless as the repetitions of a nightmare Every one
of the women in the vast crowded restaurant seemed to be of the same age to be dressed by the same dress makers loved by the same lovers adorned by the same jewellers and massaged and
manipulated by the same Beauty doctors The only difference was that the few whose greater age was no longer disguisable had shorter skirts and exposed a wider expanse of shoulder blade A double
jazz band drowned their conversation but from the movement of their lips and the accompanying gestures Boyne surmised that they were all saying exactly the same things as Joyce and Zinnie and
Mrs Lullmer It would have been unfashionable to be different and once more Boyne marvelled at the incurable simplicity of the corrupt Blessed are the pure in heart he thought for they have so many
more things to talk about Out in the offing the lights of the Fancy Girl drew an unheeded triangle of stars cruising up and
down against the dusk A breeze rising as darkness fell carried the reflection toward the shore on a multitude of little waves but the sea no longer interested the diners for it was not the hour when they
I say why shouldn t we go and finish our cigars on board Cliffe Wheater proposed yearning as always to have his new toy noticed The night was languid the guests were weary of their usual
routine of amusements and the party following the line of least resistance drifted down to the pier where the Fancy Girl s launch lay mingling the glitter of its brasses with the glow of constellations in

To morrow morning old man Wheater said his arm in Boyne s we ll have it all out about the children
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
oyne knew that morning in the vocabulary of the Lido could not possibly be construed as meaning anything earlier than the languid interval between cocktails and lunch or the still more
torpid stretch of time separating the process of digestion from the first afternoon bath All his energies were bent on getting the Wheaters to fix on one or the other of these parentheses as the most suitable
in which to examine the question of their children s future and he accounted himself lucky when they finally agreed to meet him in a quiet corner of the hotel lounge before luncheon
Unfortunately for this plan no corner of the lounge or of its adjacent terraces could be described as quiet at that particular hour The whole population of the Palace was thronging back through its
portals in quest of food and drink Hardly had Boyne settled Mr and Mrs Wheater in their fathomless armchairs his only hope of keeping them there lay in the difficulty of getting up in a hurry when Lady
Wrench drifted by polishing her nails with a small tortoiseshell implement and humming a Negro Spiritual in her hoarse falsetto
Goodness what you people doing over here plotting together in a corner Look as if you were rehearsing for a film She stopped wide eyed impudent fundamentally indifferent to everything
less successful than her own success
I don t know what we are doing Joyce returned with a touch of irritability Martin seems to think he ought to tell us how to bring up the children It obviously seemed preposterous to her that Zinnia
Wrench should be idling about polishing her nails and humming tunes while this severe mental effort was exacted of one who the night before had been up as late and danced as hard as the other
Something s got to be decided Wheater growled uncertainly
Oh well so long smiled Lady Wrench I m off to see Mendip s new tent the one he s just got over from where is it Morocco I guess he said But isn t that a sort of leather Somewhere in South
Africa anyhow They re just rigging it up It s a wonder A new tent Joyce s face lit up with curiosity and the scattered desire to participate in everything
Yes absolutely different from anything you ve ever seen The very last thing Sort of black Cubist designs on it Might give Anastase ideas for a bath wrap Hullo Gerald that you I ve been looking for
you everywhere thought you d got drowned Come along and see Mendip s tent Joyce raised a detaining hand Gerald Mr Ormerod Please I want you to stay here We re
discussing something about which I may need your advice Oh look here Joyce I say her husband interrupted
His wife gave him a glance of aggrieved dignity You don t want me to be without advice I suppose
You ve got Martin s Wheater groaned This isn t going to be a prize fight is it
I don t know It might Sit down please Gerald Mrs Wheater indicated an armchair beside her own and Ormerod reluctantly buried his long limbs in it In this heat he murmured
Oh well s long cried Lady Wrench evaporating
Joyce Cliffe Look here have you seen Mendip s new tent Mrs Lullmer exquisite fadeless her scant bathing tights inadequately supplemented by a transparent orange scarf paused in a plastic
attitude before the besieged couple Do let s rush down and take a look at it before cocktails Come on Cliffe
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Mrs Wheater drew her lips together and a slow wave of crimson rose to her husband s perspiring
See here Syb we re talking business Business Instantly Mrs Lullmer s vaporous face became as sharp edged as a cameo and her eyes
narrowed into two observation slits Been put on to something good have you I m everlastingly broke For God s sake tell me she implored
Wheater laughed No We re only trying to settle about the children The children Do you mean to say you re talking about them still That reminds me where s my
own child Pixie pet Ah there she is Darling nip up to my room will you and get mummy one of those new lipsticks no not Baiser D fendu sweet but Nouveau P ch you know the one that fits
into the gold bag the Duke gave me yesterday An ethereal sprite with a pre Raphaelite bush of fair hair and a tiny sunburnt body detached
herself from a romp with a lift boy to spring away at her mother s behest
Pixie s such a darling always does just as I tell her If only my poor Doll had listened to me Mrs
Lullmer observed to Boyne with a retrospective sigh which implied that the unhappy fate of her eldest daughter had been the direct result of resistance to the maternal counsels
Well as I was saying Boyne began again nervously
But a fresh stream of bathers reinforced by a troop of arrivals from Venice who had steamed over to the Lido for lunch closed in vociferously about the Wheaters and at the same instant the big clock on
the wall rang out the stroke of one
See here old Martin this is no time for business is it I believe Joyce has asked half of these people to lunch Wheater confessed to his friend with a shamefaced shrug But afterward
All right Afterward Lunch was over the Duke s tent had been visited and one by one the crowd in restaurant and grillroom had dispersed for bathing or bridge
Why not here Boyne suggested patiently to Mrs Wheater
Here She paused under the lifted flap of the stately Moroccan tent her astonishingly youthful figure outlined against the glitter of the sands
Why not Boyne persisted It s cool and quiet and nobody is likely to bother us Why shouldn t you and Cliffe go into this question with me now
She wavered irresolute Where s Cliffe to begin with Oh out there under Syb s umbrella of course I m perfectly willing naturally
Very well I ll go and recruit him Boyne threaded his way between the prone groups on the beach to where Mrs Lullmer lay under
the shadow of a huge orange coloured umbrella with Cliffe Wheater outspread beside her like a raised map of a mountainous country
I say Cliffe Joyce is waiting for you in the Duke s tent for our talk Wheater raised a portion of his great bulk on a languid elbow What talk Oh all right His tone
implied that at the moment it was distinctly all wrong but he got slowly to his feet gave himself a shake lit a cigarette and shambled away after Boyne At the tent door Mrs Lullmer swiftly overtook
them I suppose you don t mind she smiled at Joyce and Wheater muttered half to his wife and half to Boyne She s had so much experience with children
All I want is what is best for mine said Mrs Wheater coldly adding as they re entered the tent
Martin you ll find Gerald somewhere about Won t you please tell him to come
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Wheater gave an angry shrug and then settled down resignedly on one of the heaps of embroidered
Moroccan cushions disposed about the interior of the tent Boyne s first inclination was to come back empty handed from a simulated quest for Ormerod but reflecting that if he did so Joyce would seize
on this as another pretext for postponement he presently returned accompanied by the tutor in whose wake Lady Wrench trailed her perfumed elegance See here folks I guess if anybody s got a
right to be here I have she announced with a regal suavity That is if you re proposing to make plans about my child
This argument seemed even to Boyne incontrovertible and Lady Wrench sank down upon her cushions with a smile of triumph
Pity Buondelmonte s not here Wheater growled under his breath to Boyne and Lady Wrench catching the name instantly exclaimed But Wrenny is I left him this minute at the bar and I don t
see why I shouldn t have my own husband s advice about my own child It was finally conceded that the benefit of Lord Wrench s judgment could not properly be denied to
his wife and as Lord Wrench and the Duke of Mendip were too inseparable to be detached from one another on so trivial a pretext and as the conference was taking place in the shelter of the Duke s own
tent it surprised no one not even Boyne when the two gentlemen strolled in together and accommodated themselves on another pile of cushions Mendip wants to see how these things are
done in America Lord Wrench explained before composing himself into a repose which seemed suspiciously like slumber while the small dry lipped Duke mumbled under his brief moustache
Might come in useful you never know I m sure I don t know exactly what we re supposed to be talking about Joyce Wheater began I ve
said a hundred times that all I care for is what s best for the children Everybody knows I ve sacrificed everything for that once before And what earthly use has it been
Ah that s what I say Lady Wrench agreed with sudden sympathy You might cut yourself in pieces for a man and his dirty lawyers would come and take your child away from you the next day
and haggle over every cent of alimony But if it comes to money I ll spend as much as anybody Oh shut up Zinnia her husband softly intervened and redisposed himself to rest
I don t think you ought any of you to look at the matter from a legal stand point Boyne interrupted My friends here are awfully fond of their children and we all know they want what s best
for them The only question is how that best is to be arrived at It seems to me perfectly simple Solomon said the Duke with his dry smile
No Exactly the reverse Division is what I m here to fight against no not fight but plead Boyne turned to Cliffe Wheater For God s sake old man let the lot of them stay together
Why they were together they would have been as long as they d stayed with me Wheater grumbled helplessly
His wife reared her golden crest with a toss of defiance You don t suppose for a minute I m going to abandon my children to the kind of future Cliffe Wheater s likely to provide for them Gerald and I are
prepared So are Cliffe and I murmured Mrs Lullmer with a glance at the Duke under her studied lashes
The Duke threw back his head and became lost in an inspection of the roof of the tent Cliffe and I repeated Mrs Lullmer more incisively
Well and what about me and Wrenny I d like to know Lady Wrench broke in I guess I can afford the best lawyers in the country
I don t see that the law concerns these children Boyne intervened What they need is not to be fought over but just to be left alone Judith and Terry understand that perfectly They know there is
probably going to be another change in their parents lives but they want to remain together and not be affected by that change I m not here to theorise or criticise I m simply here as the children s
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html spokesman They re devoted to each other and they want to stay together Between you all can t it be
managed somehow for a time at any rate But my Pixie would be such a perfect little companion for Terry and Blanca She knows all the very
nicest children everywhere That s one of the great advantages of hotel life isn t it And after all Judith may be marrying soon and then what will become of the others Mrs Lullmer turned a
meaning smile on Boyne Haven t you perhaps thought of Judith s marrying soon Mr Boyne Boyne curtly replied that he hadn t and Lady Wrench intervened I want my Zinnie to have a lovely simple
home life out on our ranch in California This kicking about in hotels is too horribly demoralising for children She bent her great eyes gently on Mrs Lullmer You know something about that Mrs
Lullmer Mrs Lullmer returned a look as gentle Oh no my children were never on a ranch at Hollywood
Hollywood Hollywood gasped Lady Wrench paling with rage
Mrs Lullmer arched her delicate brows interrogatively Isn t Hollywood in California Stupid of me I was never in the West myself
Joyce Wheater raised herself on her elbow I m sure I don t see the use of this Four of the children are mine and Cliffe s I ve always tried to make them all happy I ve treated Zinnie and
Buondelmonte s children exactly like my own and this is all the thanks I get for it No one could be more competent than Gerald to direct Terry s education which is something his father never happens
to have thought of But of course everybody here is trying to put me in the wrong Mrs Lullmer looked her soft surprise Oh no Don t say that Joyce All I feel is that perhaps the
poor babies haven t been quite loved enough You don t mind my suggesting it do you If they were mine I don t think I should care so awfully much about making them into high brows What I should
want would be just to see them all healthy and rosy and happy and romping about all day like my little Pixie
With lift boys and barmen Yes I guess that is about the best preparation for life in the smart set said Lady Wrench parenthetically
Mrs Lullmer smiled Yes Pixie s little friends are all in what I believe you call the smart set I confess I think that even more important for a child than learning that Morocco is not in South Africa
Not in South Africa Where is it then I d like to know Wrenny you told me Well said the Duke getting up I m off for a swim
This announcement instantly disorganised the whole group Nothing as Boyne had already had occasion to remark chilled their interest in whatever they were doing as rapidly as the discovery that
one of the party had had enough of it and was moving on to the next item of the day s programme
And no one could dislocate a social assemblage as quickly as the Duke of Mendip The shared sense that wherever he was there the greatest amount of excitement was obtainable dominated any
divergence of view among his companions Even Lord Wrench roused himself from his slumbers and gathered up his long limbs for instant departure and his wife and Mrs Lullmer followed his example
Mercy what time is it Why there s that diving match off Ella Muncy s raft Lady Wrench exclaimed I ve got fifty pounds on the Grand Duke and directly afterward there s the mannequin
show for the smartest bathing dresses I ve given a prize for that myself Mrs Lullmer had taken a stick of rouge from her mesh bag and was critically redecorating her
small pensive face Coming Cliffe she negligently asked You re one of the judges of the diving match aren t you
Cliffe Wheater had scrambled heavily to his feet and stood casting perplexed glances about him I did say I d be I believe Damn it all I d no idea it was so late
It s always late in this place I don t see how we any of us stand it murmured Mrs Lullmer I always say we re the real labouring classes

Joyce Wheater still sat negligently reclined Very well then I suppose we may consider the matter settled
Settled settled Why what do you mean Wheater stammered uneasily from the threshold
We came here to decide about the children I believe I assume that you agree that I m to keep my own
Keep them Keep them I agree to no such thing Martin here knows what my conditions are I ve never agreed to any others and never shall
Ormerod Ormerod Where the deuce is Gerald Ormerod He s next on the diving programme and Mrs Muncy s just sent word to say that everything s being held up oh here you are Gerald Come
along for God s sake or I shall catch it A bronzed young amphibian dripping and sputtering from the sea had snatched back the tent flap
singled out Gerald Ormerod still supine in his corner and dragged him to his feet Dash it wake up old man or there ll be no end of a rumpus
Joyce Wheater sprang into sudden activity Gerald Gerald but of course you mustn t miss your turn Cliffe is the launch there to take us out to the raft How can I have forgotten all about it She
addressed herself plaintively to Boyne That s what always happens whenever there s any question of the children I forget about everything else
Wheater laid a persuasive hand on Boyne s shoulder You see how it is old man In this hell of a place there s never any time for anything See here come along with us to this diving match won t

XVII n the afternoon of the fourth day Boyne stood again in the sitting room of the ch let facing the
He had wired to Judith Wheater All right don t worry but to Mrs Sellars he had made no sign
He knew she did not wholly approve of his journey though she had made no unfavourable comment and had even offered of her own accord to keep an eye on the Pension Rosengl h in his absence It was
not necessary for Rose Sellars to formulate objections they were latent everywhere in her delicate person in the movements of her slim apprehensive fingers the guarded stir of her lashes But the
sense of their lurking there vigilant guardians of the threshold gave a peculiar quality to every token of her approval Boyne told himself that she was not a denier but that rarer being a chooser and he
was almost certain where her choice would lie when all the facts were before her
She was out when he reached the ch let and his conviction strengthened as he sat awaiting her It drew its strength from the very atmosphere of the place its self sufficing harmony Willkommen
suesser Daemmerschein His apostrophe took in the mighty landscape which overhung him the sense of peace flowed in on him from those great fastnesses of sun and solitude with which the little
low ceilinged room its books and flowers the bit of needle work in the armchair the half written letter on the desk had the humble kinship of quietness and continuity I d forgotten that anything
had any meaning he thought to himself as he let the spell of the place weave its noiseless net about him
Martin but how tired you look She was on the threshold their hands and lips together He remembered that kiss afterward She lingered close her arms on his shoulders I didn t even know
you d got back There was the faintest shadow of reproach in her tone
I didn t know till the last minute when I could get away I just jumped into the first train he explained He was conscious of the weariness in his voice He passed his hand over his eyes as though
to see if it would brush away her image or if there were still women like her in the world all made of light and reason Dear he said more to himself than her
You ve failed Her eyes were full of an unmixed sympathy there was nothing in them to remind him that they had foreseen his failure
No he exclaimed I ve succeeded Oh He fancied he detected a hint of flatness in the rejoinder there are occasions he knew when
one has to resign oneself to the hearing of good news But no he was unfair It was not that it was only the echo of his own fatigue For as she said he was tired thoroughly tired
She continued with a faint smile You don t look like somebody who has succeeded I daresay not I feel rather like one of the fellows they let down into a disused well and haul up half
asphyxiated It was asphyxiating
Some of it most of it But I m coming to And I ve got what I wanted He returned her smile and sat down beside her
How wonderful You mean to say you ve reconciled the Wheaters I ve reconciled them to the idea of not separating the children for the present at any rate
Oh Martin splendid She was really warming to the subject now Her face glowed with a delicate appreciation It will do Terry more good than all the Alps and Dolomites piled on top of one another
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Yes and Judith too incidentally He had no intention of not including Judith in his victory
Of course but Judith s a young lady who is eminently capable of fighting her own battles Mrs
Sellars smoothly rejoined
She ought to be she s had to fight everybody else s He leaned his head against the back of his armchair and wondered what had become of the glow
with which he had entered the room It had vanished instantly under the cool touch of Mrs Sellars s allusion to Judith He had succeeded it was true there could be no doubt that he had succeeded The
mere fact of gaining time was nine tenths of the battle and that he had already achieved But already too he was beginning to wonder how he was to fit Rose Sellars into the picture of his success It was
curious when they were apart it was always her courage and her ardour that he felt as soon as they came together again she seemed hemmed in by little restrictions and inhibitions
Do tell me just what happened she said
Well at the very last minute they decided to make me informally into the children s guardian a sort of trial guardian you might call it
A trial guardian Her intonation and the laugh that followed it lifted the term into the region of the absurd What a jolly thing to be a trial guardian
Well I m not so sure Boyne faced her irritably It s not a joke you know I shan t know what it is till you explain
Explain explain Yes he knew now that the explaining was just what he was dodging away from To Judith and Terry no explanations would be necessary He would only have to say It s all right and
be smothered in hugs and jubilations Those two would never think of asking for reasons life had not accustomed them to expect any But here sat lovely Logic her long hands clasped attentively
Oh by Jove Boyne exclaimed clapping his own hands first on one pocket then on another
Here s something I got for you in Venice He drew forth a small parcel stringless and shapeless as parcels generally seemed to be when they
emerged from his pockets unwrapped the paper and pressed the catch of a morocco box The lid flew open and revealed a curious crystal pendant in a network of worn enamel
Oh the lovely thing For me Oh no not that he stammered He jerked the trinket back wrapped the box up and pushed it
into his pocket with the exasperated sense of blushing like a boy over his blunder
But Martin Here He delved deeper pulled out another parcel in wrappings equally untidy and took up one
of the long hands lying on her knee This is for you He slipped on her fourth finger a sapphire set in diamonds She lowered her lids on it in gentle admiration It s much too beautiful her lips protested
Then her mockery sparkled up at him Only you ve put it on the wrong hand at least if it s meant for our engagement
Looks as if it were doesn t it he bantered back but inwardly he was thinking Yes that s just the trouble it looks like the engagement ring any other fellow would have given to any other woman
Nothing in the world to do with her and me Aloud he said I hadn t time to find what I wanted and then realised that this was hardly a way of bettering his case I wanted something so awfully
different for you he blundered on
Well your wanting that makes it different to me she said and added more tepidly Besides it s lovely She held out her left hand and he slipped the jewel on the proper finger It s rotten he
grumbled The ring had cost him more than he could afford it had failed to please her he saw himself that it was utterly commonplace and saw also that she would never forgive him for pocketing the
trinket he had first produced which was nothing in itself but had struck her fancy as soon as she knew it was not meant for her Should he pull it out again and ask her to accept it No after what had
passed that was impossible Judith Wheater if he had been trying an engagement ring on her finger
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html preposterous fancy would have blurted out at once that she preferred the trinket he had shoved back
into his pocket But such tactlessness was unthinkable in Mrs Sellars Not for the world he knew would she have let him guess that she had given the other ornament a thought
She sat turning her hand from side to side and diligently admiring the ring And now do tell me just what happened
Well first of course a lot of talk He settled himself in his chair and tried to take up the narrative But wherever he grasped it the
awkward thing seemed to tumble out of his hold as if in that respect too he were always taking the wrong parcel out of his pocket To begin with it was so difficult to explain to Mrs Sellars that after the
Wheaters had been reassured as to the safety and wellbeing of the children the negotiations had been carried on piecemeal desultorily parenthetically between swims and sun baths cocktails and
foxtrots poker and baccara and as a rule in the presence of all the conflicting interests
To make Mrs Sellars understand that Lady Wrench her husband and Gerald Ormerod had assisted at the debates as a matter of course was in itself a laborious business to convey to her that Mrs
Lullmer still notorious as the former Mrs Westway had likewise been called upon to participate as Joyce s possible successor was to place too heavy a strain on her imagination Her exquisite aloofness
had kept her in genuine ignorance of the compromises and promiscuities of modern life and left on her hands the picture of a vanished world wherein you didn t speak to people who were discredited or
admit rivals or enemies to your confidence and she punctuated Boyne s narrative with murmurs of dismay and incredulity
But in that crowd Boyne explained no man is another man s enemy for more than a few minutes and no woman is any other woman s rival Either they forget they ve quarrelled or some social
necessity usually a party that none of them can bear to miss forces them together and makes it easier to bury their differences But generally it s a simple case of forgetting Their memories are as
short as a savage s and the feuds that savages remember have dropped out They recall only the other primitive needs food finery dancing I suppose we are relapsing into a kind of bloodless savagery
Besides he went on in the Wheater set they could deal with things only collectively alone they became helpless and inarticulate They lived so perpetually in the lime light that they required an
audience an audience made up of their own kind Before each other they shouted and struck attitudes again like savages But the chief point was that nobody could stay angry not however much
they tried It was too much trouble and might involve too many inconveniences interfere with too many social arrangements When all was said and done all they asked was not to be bothered and it
was by gambling on that requirement that he had finally gained his point
And your point is exactly Well as he got closer to it Boyne was not even sure that it could be defined as a point It was too
shapeless and undecided but he hoped it would serve for a time and time was everything especially for Terry
They ve agreed to leave the children together and to leave them here for the next three or four months The longest to bring round was Lady Wrench Her husband has taken a fancy to Zinnie and
he s so mortally bored by life in general that his wife clutches at anything that may amuse him Luckily according to the terms of the divorce
Which divorce Mrs Sellars interpolated as though genuinely anxious to keep her hand on all the clues
Wheater versus Zinnia Lacrosse It was Wheater who got the divorce from the present Lady Wrench Legally he has the final say about Zinnie so the mother had to give in though she has a right
to see the child at stated intervals But of course my battle royal was over Chipstone if the Wheaters had insisted on keeping Chipstone till their own affairs were settled in court the whole combination
would have been broken up
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
And how did you contrive to rescue Chipstone Boyne sank down more deeply into his armchair and looked up at the low ceiling Then he
straightened himself and brought his gaze to the level of Mrs Sellars s By promising to stay here and keep an eye on the children myself That s my trial guardianship He gave a slight laugh which she
Martin His eyes continued to challenge hers Well
She turned the sapphire hesitatingly on her finger But these children you d never even heard of them till you met them on board your steamer a few weeks ago
No that s true You ve taken over a pretty big responsibility
I like responsibilities Mrs Sellars was still brooding over her newly imprisoned finger It s very generous of you to
assume this one in such a hurry Usually one doesn t have to go out of one s way to find rather more of them than one can manage But in this case I wonder
You wonder Well I had understood from Terry and also from your friend Judith that what all the children
really want is to go to America to Mrs Wheater s mother isn t it Yes that s it and I hope they ll pull it off by and by But at present the Wheaters won t hear of it I
never for a moment supposed they d consent to putting the ocean between themselves and Chip My only chance was to persuade them that now Terry s in the mountains they d better leave him here
and the others with him till the hot weather s over With those people it s always a question of the least resistance of temporizing and postponing My plan saved everybody a certain amount of mental
effort so they all ended by agreeing to it But of course it s merely provisional Happily Mrs Sellars smiled and added as if to correct the slight acerbity of the comment For
you must see dear that you re taking a considerable risk for the future What future
Why suppose anything goes wrong during these next few months You ll be answerable for whatever may happen With seven children and one of them already grown up
Boyne frowned and stirred uneasily in his chair If you mean Judith in some ways she s as much of a child as the youngest of them
Mrs Sellars smiled confidentially at her ring So a man would think I suppose But you forget that I ve had four days alone with her She s a young lady with very definite views
I should hope so I agree with you that it makes her more interesting but conceivably it might lead to
complications What sort of complications
You ought to know better than I do since you tell me you ve been frequenting the late Mrs
Westway at the Lido Judith doesn t pretend to hide the fact that she lived for a summer in the bosom of that edifying family
She doesn t know it s anything to hide That s what s so touching And so terrifying But I won t sit here preaching prudence you d only hate me for it And all this
time those poor infants are waiting She stood up with one of her sudden changes of look and tone as if a cloud had parted shedding a ray of her lost youth on her He noticed for the first time that she was
all in white a rose on her breast and a shady hat hanging from her arm Do go down and see them at once dear It s getting late I ll walk with you to the foot of the hill then I must come back and write
some letters He smiled at the familiar formula and she took up his smile Yes really important

When the break up comes as of course it will why shouldn t you and I adopt him She put on her hat and linked her arm in Boyne s for the walk down the hill but at the fringe of the

ecent memories of Armistice Day remote ones of Mafeking Night which he had chanced to experience in London paled for Boyne in the uproar raised by the little Wheaters when entering
their pension dining room he told them that everything was all right
He had not imagined that seven could be so many The miracle of the loaves and fishes seemed as nothing to the sudden multiplication of arms legs and lungs about that rural supper table At one end
of the expanse of coarse linen and stout crockery Miss Scope rigid and spectacled sat dispensing jam without fear or favour at the other Judith was cutting bread and butter in complete unawareness of
her immortal model Between the two surged a sea of small heads dusky ruddy silver pale all tossing and mixing about the golden crest of Chipstone throned in his umpire s chair For a moment as usual
Bun and Zinnie dominated the scene then Terry still pale but with new life in his eyes caught his cap from the rack with a call for three cheers to which the others improvised a piercing echo Luckily
we re the only boarders just now Miss Scope remarked to Boyne as he pressed her hand In this wonderful world nobody asked any questions nobody seemed to care for any particulars
their one thought was to bestow on their ambassador the readiest token of their gratitude from Blanca s cool kiss to the damp and strangulating endearments of Beechy To Boyne it was literally like
a dip into a quick sea with waves that burnt his eyes choked his throat and ears but stung him body and brain to fresh activity And now let s kiss him all over again and it s my turn first Zinnie
rapturously proposed and as he abandoned himself once more to the battering of the breakers he caught a small voice piping We suppose you ve brought some presents for us Martin
The law which makes men progressively repeople the world with persons of their own age and experience had led Boyne as he grew older to regard human relations as more and more ruled by
reason but whenever he dipped into the universe of the infant Wheaters where all perspective ceased and it was far more urgent to know what presents he had brought than what fate had been meted out
to them by their respective parents he felt the joy of plunging back into reality
The presents were there and nobody had been forgotten as the rapid unpacking of a small suit case showed nobody that is but Judith who stood slightly apart affecting an air of grown up
amusement while Blanca and the little girls were hung with trinkets and Bun made jubilant by an electric lamp Even Miss Scope had an appropriate reticule Nanny a lavishly garnished needle case
and the bottom of the box was crammed with books for Terry
The distributing took so long and the ensuing disputes and counter claims were so difficult of adjustment that twilight was slipping down the valley when Boyne said to Judith Come and take a
turn and I ll tell you all about it They walked along the road to a path which led up the hillside opposite to the hotels and from there
began to mount slowly toward the receding sunlight Judith unasked had slipped her arm through Boyne s and the nearness of her light young body was like wings to him What a pity it s getting dark
I believe I could climb to one of those ruby peaks he said throwing his head back with a deep breath and she instantly rejoined Let s run back and get Bun s lamp then we could
Boyne laughed and went on in a voice of leisurely satisfaction Oh Bun wouldn t part with that lamp not yet Besides we re very well as we are and there ll be lots of other opportunities
There will Oh Martin they re really going to let us stay Her strong young hands imprisoned him in a passionate grasp
Well for a time I made them see it was Terry s best chance
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Of course it is And Martin they ll leave us all together Chip and all Every man of you for the summer at any rate They had stopped in the fern fringed path and he
stood above her smiling down into her blissful incredulous eyes There s one condition though Her gaze darkened and he added You re all to be accountable to me I ve promised your people to
keep an eye on you You mean you re going to stay here with us Her lips trembled with the tears she was struggling to
keep back and he thought to himself It s too much for a child s face to express Aloud he said
Let s sit down and watch the sunset This tree trunk is a pretty good proscenium box They sat down and he set forth at length the history of his negotiations Complicated as the
narrative was it was easier to relate to his present hearer than to Mrs Sellars not only because fewer elucidations were necessary but because none of the details he gave shocked or astonished Judith The
tale he told evidently seemed to her a mere bald statement of a matter of course affair and she was too much occupied with its practical results to give a thought to its remoter bearings She listened
attentively to Boyne s report of the final agreement and when he had ended said only I suppose father s made some arrangement about paying our bills
Your father s opened an account for me Miss Scope and I are to be your ministers of finance She received this in silence for the first time since his return he felt that the news he brought was
still overshadowed for her At last she asked Was father awfully angry you know about that money
The question roused Boyne with a start He perceived that in his struggle to adjust conflicting interests he too had lost sight of the moral issue And how confess to Judith that as for her father he
had hardly been aware of it He felt that it was a moment for prevarication Of course your father was angry thoroughly angry about the whole thing Anybody would have been
She lowered her voice to insist But I mean about my taking his money Well he s forgiven you for that at any rate
Has he really and truly Her voice lifted again joyfully Terry was sure he never would Boyne turned about on her in surprise Terry then you told him after all
She made a mute sign of assent I had to Well I understand that He gave her hand a little squeeze I m glad you did
He was frightfully upset you know And furious with me I was afraid I d made him more ill He wouldn t believe me at first He said if I had no more moral sense than that the first thing I knew I d
land in prison Oh Boyne could not restrain a faint laugh
That didn t worry me very much though Judith confessed in a more cheerful tone because I ve seen a good deal more of life than Terry and I ve known other girls who ve done what I did and none
of them ever went to prison This did not seem as reassuring to Boyne as it did to the speaker but the hour for severity was over
the words of rebuke died on his lips At last he said The worst of it was hurting Terry wasn t it and she nodded Yes
For a while after that they sat without speaking till she asked him if he thought the Wheaters had already started divorce proceedings To this he could only answer that it looked so but he still hoped
they might calm down and think better of it She received this with a gesture of incredulity and merely remarked There might have been a chance if Syb Lullmer hadn t been mixed up in it
I do wish you wouldn t call that woman by her Christian name Boyne interrupted
Judith looked at him with a gentle wonder She wouldn t mind Everybody else does She clearly assumed that he was reproving her for failing in respect to Mrs Lullmer
That s not what I meant But she s such a beast
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Oh well Judith s shrug implied that the epithet was too familiar to her to have kept more than a
tinge of obloquy I rather hope she won t marry father though I hope to God she won t What I m gambling on is that he and your mother will get so homesick for
you children that they ll patch things up on your account Her smile kept its soft incredulity They don t often you know parents don t
Well anyhow you ve got a reprieve and you must make the most of it I wish you d say we not you Martin
Why of course it s we my dear that is as long as you all behave yourselves They both laughed at this and then fell silent facing the sunset and immersed in their different
ways in the overwhelming glory of the spectacle Judith Boyne knew did not feel sunsets as Rose Sellars did they appealed to a different order of associations and she would probably have been put
to it to distinguish the quality of their splendour from that of fireworks at the Lido or a brilliant finale at the Russian ballet But something of the celestial radiance seemed to reach her remote yet
enfolding as a guardian wing It s lovely here she breathed her hand in Boyne s
He remembered at a similar moment Rose Sellars s quoting
All the peaks soar but one the rest excels
No yonder sparkle is the citadel s Circling its summit
and he murmured the words half aloud
Judith s pressure tightened ardently on his hand Oh Martin how beautifully you do describe things The words you find are not like anybody else s Terry says you ought to be a writer
Well in this case unluckily somebody found the words before me Oh Her enthusiasm flagged She hazarded Mrs Sellars
He gave a little chuckle at her sharpness In a way yes but as a matter of fact Robert Browning got ahead of both of us
This seemed to give her a certain satisfaction Then she just cribbed it from him Is he another friend of hers
Yes and will be of yours some day I hope He died long before you were born but you ll find some of the best of him in one of the books I brought to Terry
Oh he s just an author you mean she murmured as if the state were a strictly posthumous one
Her attention always had a tendency to wander at the mention of books and he thought she was probably a little vexed at having been betrayed into a conversational slip but presently with a return
of her habitual buoyancy I d rather hear you talk than anybody who s dead she declared
All right I ll make it a rule to give you only my own vintage he agreed gazing out past her into the light They continued to sit there in silence the sea of night creeping softly up to them till at length
they were caught in its chill touch Boyne got reluctantly to his feet Come along child Time to go down he said
Oh not down yet up up up She caught his arm again pulling him with all her young strength along the pine scented steep to where the mystery of the forest drew down to meet them I want to
climb and climb don t you I want to stay up all night as if we were coming home at sunrise from a ball It s like a great ballroom over there isn t it she cried pointing to the west with the lights
pouring out of a million windows Boyne laughed and suffered himself to be led onward The air on that height was as fresh as youth
and all about them were the secret scents that dew and twilight waken into life He knew that he and Judith ought to be turning homeward but even if she had released his captive arm it was growing too
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html dark to consult his watch Besides the wandering man in him the man used to mountains to long
lonely tramps to the hush and mystery of nights in the open felt himself in the toils of the old magic
It was no longer Judith drawing him on but the night itself beckoning him to fresh heights The child at his side had travelled with him into the beauty as far as she could go and now he needed nothing
from her but the warmth of her nearness His highest moments had always been solitary
She seemed to guess that there was nothing else to say and they continued to mount the hill in silence As they rose the air turned colder the fires faded and above them arched a steel blue heaven
starred with ruddy points which grew keen and white as darkness deepened It was not till they passed out of the fringes of the forest to an open crag above the valley and saw the village lights sprinkling the
black fields far below that Boyne unwillingly woke to the sense of time and place
Oh by Jove you must come he exclaimed swinging round to guide his companion down the ledge
She made no answer but turned and followed him along the descending path He could feel that she was too tired and peaceful for reluctance She moved beside him like a sleepy child bringing back an
apronful of flowers from a happy holiday and the fact of having reassured her so quickly awed Boyne a little as if he had meddled with destiny But it was pleasant for once to play the god and he let
himself drift away into visions of a vague millennium where all the grown people knew what they wanted and if ever it happened that they didn t the children had the casting vote
By the time they reached the pension and Judith had loosed her hold of Boyne s arm he was afraid to look at his watch but pushed her through the gate with a quick goodnight and then a moment
later called to her in an imperious whisper Judith She hurried back to the summons
Did you really think I hadn t brought you any present She gave an excited little laugh N no I really thought perhaps you had only
Only what I thought you d forgotten some one else s and had imagined I shouldn t much mind your taking
mine because I m so much older than the others Well of course I should have imagined that but here it is
He pulled out the parcel he had inadvertently produced in Mrs Sellars s sitting room and Judith caught it to her with a gasp of pleasure
Oh Martin There own up that you d have been fearfully sold if I d forgotten you
She answered solemnly If you d forgotten me I should have died of it Well run off with you we re hours late he admonished her
Mayn t I look at it before you go You baby how could you see in the dark Besides I tell you there s no time
Not even time to kiss you for it Martin No he cried slamming the gate shut and starting up the hill toward his hotel at a run
When they started on their walk nothing had been farther from Boyne s mind than this disposal of the crystal pendant though it was for Judith that the trinket had been chosen Since Mrs Sellars
owing to his blunder had seen and coveted it he felt a certain awkwardness about letting it appear on Judith s neck and decided that his little friend must again be left out in the general distribution of
presents But during their walk in the mountain dusk while she hung on his arm pressed close by the intruding fir branches he needed more and more to think of her as a child and thinking thus to treat
her as one He knew how the child in her must have ached at being left out when he unpacked his gifts
and when the time came to say goodnight it was irresistible to heal that ache There was no way of doing it but to take the pendant from his pocket the pendant which he had meant for her and which
it had taken so long to unearth at the Venetian antiquary s that there was no time for much thought of
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Mrs Sellars s the pendant which was Judith s by right because like her it was odd and exquisite and
If only she doesn t parade it up at the ch let the coward in him thought as he climbed the hill
But all the while he knew it was exactly what she would do
Oh well damn after all I chose it for her he grumbled as if that justified them both
In the ch let sitting room Mrs Sellars in her cool evening dress looked up from the table at which she sat not writing a letter but reading one She laid it down thoughtfully as he entered
I m afraid it s awfully late I hadn t time to go to the hotel and brush up you don t mind he said blinking a little in the lamplight and passing his hand through his rumpled hair As he bent to kiss her
his glance fell on the admonishing needles of the little travelling clock at her elbow You don t mean to say it s after nine
What does it matter As a matter of fact it s after half past I was only afraid something had gone wrong about the children
He tossed his hat down with a laugh Bless you no Everything s as right as right But I had to get the Lido out of my lungs and a long tramp was the only way
Her smile told him how much she loved him for hating the Lido And what do you think my news is You know I said I had something to tell you Mr Dobree is coming here to see me he arrives next
week She announced the fact as if it were not only important but even exciting
Oh damn Mr Dobree Boyne rejoined with a careless benevolence The door had opened on the candlelight of their little dinner table on its sparkle of white wine and smell of wild strawberries and
village bread Well this is good enough for me Boyne said as he dropped into the seat opposite Mrs
Sellars with a sense of proprietorship which made Mr Dobree s movements seem wholly negligible

XIX he next day there occurred with a fatal punctuality exactly what Boyne had foreseen Mrs Sellars
had invited Judith Terry and Blanca to lunch and when they appeared Mrs Sellars s eye instantly lit on the crystal pendant Judith s on the sapphire ring The mutual reconnaissance was swift and
silent as the crossing of search lights in a night sky Judith said nothing but Blanca as Mrs Sellars bent to kiss her raised her hostess s hand with an admiring exclamation A new ring What a beauty
I never saw you wear it before Mrs Sellars smiled and tapped Blanca s cheek with her free hand What sharp eyes But everybody
seems to have had a present from Venice so why shouldn t I Blanca returned the smile lifting her own wrist to display a hoop of pink crystal Isn t mine sweet
Nobody finds presents like Martin So I thought when he showed me Judith s last night
Mrs Sellars turned to the older girl but not to kiss her She reserved her endearments for the younger children and merely laid a friendly touch on Judith s shoulder Such a wonder that pendant
I never saw one like it Decidedly not Venetian seventeenth century Spanish perhaps It s a puzzle
You re lucky my dear to have a connaisseur to choose your presents That was all and then a jolly lunch simple easy full of chaff and laughter Mrs Sellars always a
perfect hostess was at her best with Terry and Blanca The boy touched and interested her the little girl Boyne divined subtly flattered her by a wide eyed but tactful admiration Boyne wondered if Mrs
Sellars had noticed how Blanca s clear gray eyes darkened with envy at the praise of the crystal pendant What a fool he had been not to give the crystal to Blanca and the tuppenny bracelet to
Judith who would have liked it best because it came from him Decidedly he was doomed to blunder in his dealings with women even when they were no more than little girls Meanwhile Terry was
telling Mrs Sellars about the books Boyne had brought him and how he and Judith had already hunted down Boyne s quotation from The Grammarian s Funeral You know that splendid one he
told Judith yesterday about all the peaks soar she came home last night saying it over and over for fear she d forget it and woke me up to hunt for it before she went to bed
It was so splendid hearing it up there on the mountain in the dark with the stars coming out Judith glowed taking up the tale while Blanca ingenuously added It was so late when Judy got home
that we were all asleep and Scopy had to go down and let her in Did you see Scopy in her crimpingpins Martin or had you gone when she opened the door Yes the coming of twilight up on the heights is something to remember Mrs Sellars intervened
letting her eyes rest attentively on Boyne s before she turned them again to Terry But there are better things than that in Browning you know Bring me your book to morrow and I ll show you
It all went off perfectly and Boyne when he started the children homeward after lunch was wondering whether tact were as soothing as a summer breeze or as terrible as an army with banners
He was to drop the young Wheaters at their pension and afterward meet Mrs Sellars at the postoffice for a climb in the direction of Misurina At the corner of the highroad descending to Cortina he signalled the hotel omnibus packed in the twins and walked on with Judith At the moment he would
rather have escaped from the whole party but Judith had declared her intention of walking and he could not do otherwise than go with her They waited under the trees for the omnibus to sweep on with
its load of dust and passengers and almost at once Judith said I suppose you re engaged to Mrs
Sellars aren t you Martin
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
The suddenness of the question struck him like a blow and he realised for the first time that he had never spoken to Rose Sellars about making their engagement known He had never even asked her if
she had broken the news to her formidable aunt or to the galaxy of minor relatives with whom she maintained her incessant exchange of letters Her insistence that their marriage should be put off for
nearly half a year seemed to make the whole question too remote for immediate decisions I suppose I ought to have asked her if she wanted it announced he thought reflecting remorsefully that his long
exile had made him too careless of the social observances He turned an irritated eye on Judith What in the world put such an idea into your head
Why your bringing her a ring from Venice and her putting it on the finger where engagement rings are worn Judith replied with a smiling promptness
Oh that s the finger is it Boyne said temporising and then with an abrupt clutch at simplification Yes I am engaged to Mrs Sellars But I don t think she wants it spoken of at present
He turned his gaze away to the long white road glinting through the trees under which he and Judith were withdrawn Things happened so suddenly and overwhelmingly in Judith s face that he did not
feel equal to what might be going on there till he had steadied his gaze by a protracted study of the landscape When he looked at her again he received the shock of smiling lips and eyes and two arms
thrown filially about him
You darling old Martin I m so glad At least I am if you are really and truly Her hug was almost as suffocating as Zinnie s and given he divined it instantly with the same
wholehearted candour So Blanca was right after all How lovely it must be to be in love For I suppose that s the reason why you re marrying I know you re awfully romantic though you
sometimes put on such a gruff manner I m sure you wouldn t marry just for position or for money or to regularise an old liaison would you
An old liaison Boyne laughed but with a touch of vexation The ideas you ve picked up and the lingo You absurd child why regularise isn t even English And can t you see can t you imagine
that a man s first need is to to respect the woman he hopes to marry Judith received this with a puzzled frown Oh I can see it I have often in books and at the
movies But I can t imagine it exactly I should have thought wanting to give her a good hug came before anything
Boyne shrugged impatiently Things that seemed funny and utterly guileless when she said them to others shocked him when she commented on his private concerns in the vocabulary of her tribe
What s the use You re only a baby and you repeat things like a parrot as all children do Mrs Sellars is the most perfect the most exquisite He broke off feeling that such asseverations led nowhere in
particular and continued at a tangent I can tell you one thing I should never have dared to take on the job of looking after you children if she hadn t been here
Judith s face fell Oh is she going to stay all summer then I devoutly hope so Being with somebody like her is so exactly what This again seemed to land
him in a sort of rhetorical blind alley and he stepped down from it into the dust of the highroad
Come along we mustn t dawdle I m due at the post office He was aware that a settled anger was possessing him he hardly knew why Hardly yet just under the surface of his mind there stirred the
uneasy sense that he was perhaps disappointed by Judith s prompt congratulations Half an hour earlier he would have said that her approval would add the final touch to his happiness that there was
nothing he wanted more than to have her show herself in fact the child he was perpetually calling her
The youngest of them all that was how he had described her to Mrs Sellars Was it possible he had not meant what he said
He was roused by Judith s squeeze on his arm I don t know why you re so cross with me old Martin I do really want anything you want
That s a good Judy and what rot dear thinking I m cross Only remember it s your secret and mine and not another soul s After all he tried to tell himself Judith s knowing of his engagement

was already a relief It would do away with no end of hedging and prevaricating And he was sure he could trust to Judith s discretion sure of it without her added pressure on his arm and the solemn
On Scopy s book which had become the tribal oath of the little Wheaters Boyne had sometimes winced at Judith s precocious discretion as another proof of what she had been exposed to now he
hailed in it a guaranty of peace Perhaps there s something to be said for not keeping children in cotton wool for she is only a child he repeated to himself insistently
That very evening while he and Mrs Sellars were talking over the likelihood of picking up some kind of a tutor for Terry she asked irrelevantly By the way do the children know of our
engagement Contradictory answers rose to Boyne s lips and he gulped them down to mumble I didn t suppose
I was authorized to tell anybody But hasn t anybody guessed
Well as a matter of fact Judith has Today I can t imagine Mrs Sellars smiled My ring of course Trust Blanca too It was stupid of me not to think of it But
perhaps it s better Much better
She pondered Only I d rather no one else knew at least for the present Out of regard for Aunt Julia till I ve heard from her Boyne relieved expressed his complete agreement Besides she
continued I like it s being our secret don t you We won t even tell Mr Dobree Oh particularly not Mr Dobree Boyne replied emphatically
Two days later Mr Dobree arrived and Boyne learned that an event which seems negligible before it happens may fill the picture when it becomes a fact The prospect of Mr Dobree s arrival had now
become the fact of Mr Dobree s presence and Mr Dobree though still spare and nimble for a man approaching sixty he was ready and glad to tell you to what exercises he owed it took up a
surprising amount of room He was like somebody who travels with a lot of unwieldy luggage his luggage being as it were the very absence of it being his tact his self effacingness his general
neatness and compactness Wherever you turned you were in the aura of Mr Dobree s retractility his earnest and insistent dodging out of your way which seemed to leave behind it a presence more
oppressive than any mere physical bulk so that a dull fat man rooted in your best armchair might have been less in the way than the slim and disappearing Mr Dobree Mr Dobree s tact seemed to
Boyne like a parody of Mrs Sellars s like one of those monstrous blooms into which hybridizers transform a delicate flower It was a show tact a huge unique disbudded tact grown under glass
and destined to be labelled exhibited given a prize and a name and a page to itself in the florists catalogues Such at least was Boyne s distorted vision of the new guest at the ch let
Mr Dobree as became a man with such impedimenta was lodged not at Boyne s inn but at the Palace where Boyne and Mrs Sellars had once dined From there a brisk five minutes carried him to
the ch let except when his urgent hospitality drew Mrs Sellars and Boyne to the big hotel The prompt returning of invitations was a fundamental part of Mr Dobree s code He seemed to think that
hospitality was something a gentleman might borrow like money but never in any circumstances receive as a gift and this obliged Mrs Sellars to accept his repeated invitations before in the battle of
their tacts hers came off victorious and she made him see that it may be more blessed to receive than to be invited out The sapphire had vanished from her finger before Mr Dobree s arrival and this
precaution for which Boyne blessed her made him for Mr Dobree simply an old friend a guest of the Sellars s in New York days whom one could be suitably pleased to meet again
Boyne was less pleased to meet Mr Dobree His coming was natural enough and so was Mrs
Sellars s pleasure at seeing him since he brought not only the latest news of Aunt Julia but papers which settled satisfactorily the matter of Mr Sellars s will Boyne had resented what promised to be a
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html tiresome interruption of pleasant habits but before long he discovered that Mr Dobree s presence left
him free to spend much more time with his young friends of the Pension Rosengl h This made him aware that during the last weeks he had forfeited a certain amount of his liberty and he found himself
perilously pleased to recover it He assured Mrs Sellars that it would look very odd to Mr Dobree who had come to discuss family matters with his client if a third person were present at these discussions
and armed with this argument he proceeded to dispose of his time as he pleased
His liberation gave a new savour to the hours spent with the little Wheaters and as for Mr Dobree with whom the children had had only one brief and awe inspiring encounter he came in very handily
as the theme of the games they were always calling on Boyne to invent To ascertain Mr Dobree s Christian name Boyne told them had long been his secret ambition but hitherto he had not even
been able to learn its first letter A chance glimpse of Mr Dobree s glossy suit cases showed his initials to be A D and the letter A was one calculated as Boyne said to give them a good gallop Indeed he
found the puzzle so absorbing that one day when Judith remarked on his unusual absent mindedness he had to own that he had not been listening to what she said because all his faculties were still
absorbed in the task of guessing Mr Dobree s Christian name
But Mrs Sellars must know why don t you ask her Must know Do you think so I doubt it
But she talks of him as an old friend as old as you Even that doesn t convince me I doubt if anybody knows Mr Dobree s Christian name How
should they Can you imagine anybody s ever having called him by it or dared to ask him what it was
Well you might ask her suggested Judith from whose make up a taste for abstract speculation was absent
Ask her Not for the world Suppose she did know All our fun would be over Of course it would cried Terry plunging into the sport If she knows she mustn t be asked till
we ve exhausted every other possibility must she Martin Certainly not I see you grasp the rules of the game And now let s proceed by elimination Abel
Abel s the first name in A isn t it Terry No There s a Prince Aage of Denmark or something I saw him in The Tatler exulted Terry
All right Let s begin with Aage Do any of you see Mr Dobree as Aage This was dismissed with a general shout of incredulity
Well then as Abel Abel Dobree Don t be in a hurry try to deal with this thing in a mood of deliberateness and impartiality
No no no not Abel the assistance chorused
Oh I m going to sleep Judith grumbled stretching out at full length on the sunburnt grass bank on which the party were encamped
Let her for all the use she is Boyne jeered Now then Adam Adam s a Polish name isn t it Who was Adam Judith opened her eyes to ask
A national hero I think said Blanca with a diligent frown
Miss Scope perched higher up the bank cut through these conjectures with a groan Children children One would think I d brought you up like savages Adam
Oh Scopy means the Adam in the Bible but Mr Dobree s parents wouldn t have called him after anybody as far away as that Blanca shrugged while Zinnie interposed Who was already dead and
couldn t have given him a lovely cup for his christening Beechy her face wrinkling up in sympathy at such a privation wailed out Oh poor little Mr Dobree and Boyne recognizing the difficulty
pursued Aeneas then but he s almost as far away as Adam I m afraid
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html This drew him into a discussion with Terry regarding the relative seniority of the Biblical and
Virgilian heroes in the intervals of which Miss Scope continued to demand despairingly But what in the world are you all arguing about when we know that Adam was the First Man
Judith lifted her head again from its grassy pillow With half closed eyes she murmured to the sky
I don t believe Mr Dobree would care a bit if his godfather was Adam or not He could buy himself any christening cup he liked I believe he s a very rich man
Oh then do you think he ll give us all some lovely presents when he goes Zinnie promptly inferred
What makes you think he ll ever go Judith retorted closing her eyes

rs Sellars s social discipline was too perfect to permit her even in emergencies to neglect one obligation for another and after Mr Dobree had been for a week at Cortina she said one day to
Boyne But I ve seen nothing lately of the little Wheaters What s become of them He assured her that they were all right but had probably been too shy to present themselves at the
ch let since Mr Dobree s arrival to which Mrs Sellars replied with the faintest hint of tartness that she had never had occasion to suspect the little Wheaters of being shy and that furthermore Mr
Dobree did not happen to be staying at the ch let
Boyne smiled No but they know he s with you a good deal and he s a more impressive figure than they re used to
He saw that she scented irony in this and was not wholly pleased with it I don t know what you mean by impressive I didn t know anything in the world could impress the modern hotel child But
Mr Dobree is very sorry for them poor dears and I m sure it would interest him to see something of them Why shouldn t we take them all on a picnic to morrow I know Mr Dobree would like to invite
them Boyne felt that for all the parties concerned the undertaking might prove formidable He pointed
out that if Zinnie and the two Buondelmonte children were included in an all day expedition Miss Scope s presence would be necessary since otherwise all Judith s energies would be absorbed in
keeping the party in order and Mrs Sellars acquiesced Yes the poor little things are dreadfully spoilt
Boyne was secretly beginning to be of the same mind but Mrs Sellars could no longer criticise his young friends without rousing his instinctive opposition They certainly haven t had much
opportunity to become little Lord Fauntleroys if that s what you mean he said impatiently and his betrothed rejoined What I mean is that Mr Dobree feels sorry for them because of the kind of
opportunity they have had You see he was one of the lawyers in the Westway divorce Boyne gave her a quick look in which he was conscious that his resentment flamed I m hanged if I
see what there can be in Mr Dobree s mind to make him connect the Westway divorce with the Wheater children
Why simply his knowledge of Judith s intimacy with that wretched drug soaked Doll Westway and his familiarity with the horrible details that led up to the girl s suicide She and Judith were together at
Deauville the very summer that she killed herself Both their mothers had gone off heaven knows where Judith proclaims the fact to every one as you know
Boyne had removed his eyes from Mrs Sellars s face and was staring out at the familiar outline of the great crimson mountains beyond the balcony A phrase of Stevenson s about the lovely and
detested scene from The Ebb tide he thought strayed through his mind as he gazed It was hateful to him to think that he might hereafter come to associate those archangelic summits with Mrs
Lullmer s smooth impervious face and Mr Dobree s knowledge of the inner history of the Westway divorce
He turned back to Mrs Sellars Aren t you getting rather sick of this place he asked abruptly
She gave back his irritated stare with one of genuine surprise Sick of what You mean of Cortina Of the whole show His sweeping gesture gathered up in one contemptuous handful the vast
panorama of mountain vale and forest I always feel that when scenery gets mixed up with our

personal bothers all the virtue goes out of it as if our worries were so many locusts eating everything bare
Mrs Sellars was silent for a moment then her hand fell on his I ve always been afraid dear that this queer responsibility you ve assumed was going to end by getting on your nerves
Boyne jumped up drawing abruptly away from her Responsibility What responsibility He walked across the room turned back and awkwardly laid an answering caress on her hair Gammon
It s Mr Dobree who gets on my nerves just a little Hypocrite he cursed himself inwardly Fact is I liked Cortina a damned sight better when you and I and the children had it all to ourselves He
saw the light of reassurance in her averted cheek Just my beastly selfishness I know I needn t tell you that men are beastly selfish need I He laughed and her faint laugh echoed his
Mr Dobree is going soon I believe she volunteered
Boyne pulled himself together Well that makes it a good deal easier to be unselfish while he s here and I take it upon myself to accept his picnic for to morrow I ll drop down and announce it to the
children He flattered himself that his simulation of buoyancy had produced the desired effect and that his parting from Mrs Sellars was unclouded But halfway down the hill he stood suddenly still in
the path and exclaimed aloud But after he s gone what then The picnic was beautifully successful one of those smooth creaseless well oiled successes as to
which one feels that at any moment it may slip from one s hold and reveal the face of failure A very Janus of a picnic Boyne thought
To the chief actors however it presented no such duality but was the perfect image of what constitutes A Good Time For The Young People when made out of the happy union of tact and money
To Mr Dobree it was certainly that and he was justified in feeling that if you order the two roomiest and most balloon tired motors obtainable and fill enough hampers with the most succulent delicacies
of a Palace restaurant and are actuated throughout by the kindliest desire to give pleasure happiness will automatically follow
As regards the younger members of the party it undoubtedly did Terry was strong enough to enjoy the long day on the heights without fear of Miss Scope s thermometer Blanca was impressed by the
lavish fare which replaced their habitual bread and chocolate and the small children were in the state of effervescence induced by freedom from lessons and the sense of being the central figures of the day
After lunch the younger members of the party trailed away with Miss Scope to hunt for wild strawberries while the others sat pillowed in moss beside a silver waterfall Boyne supine against his
boulder studied the scene and meditated from behind a screen of pipe smoke Judith a little way off leaned luxuriously against her mossy cushion her hat tossed aside her head resting in the curve of an
immature arm Her profile looked small and clear against the auburn tremor of bracken turned inward by the rush of the water A live rose burned in her cheeks darkening her eyebrows and lashes and
putting a velvet shadow under her closed lids She had fallen asleep and sleep surrendered her unguarded to her watchers
She looks almost grown up she looks kissable Why should she all of a sudden Boyne asked himself suddenly disturbed not by her increased prettiness the measure of that varied from hour to
hour but by some new quality in it He turned his eyes away and they fell on Mr Dobree who sat facing him in the studied abandon of a picnicker unused to picnics Mr Dobree s inexhaustible
wardrobe had supplied him with just the slightly shabby homespun suit and slightly faded hat adapted to the occasion and Boyne wondered whether it were this change of dress which made him also seem
different But no the difference was deeper Despite his country clothes Mr Dobree did not look easier or less urban he merely looked more excited and off his guard His clear cautious eyes had
grown blurred and furtive one could almost see a faint line stretching from them to the recumbent Judith Along that line it was manifest that Mr Dobree s thoughts were racing and Boyne knew they
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
were the same thoughts as his own The discovery shocked him indescribably But he remembered that the levelling tendencies of modern life have levelled differences of age with the rest and that Mr
Dobree was to all intents and purposes but little older than himself Moreover he was still brisk and muscular his glance was habitually alert in spite of his silver hair there seemed no reason why he
should not share with Boyne the contemplation of Judith s defenceless beauty
But if this was Boyne s conclusion it was apparently not Mr Dobree s As Boyne continued to observe him Mr Dobree s habitual pinkness turned to a red which suffused even his temples and
eyelids so that his carefully brushed white hair looked like a sunlit cloud against an angry sky But with whom was Mr Dobree angry Why with himself manifestly His eyes still rested on the
dreaming Judith but the rest of his face looked as if every muscle were tightened in the effort to pull the eyes away He s frightened he s frightened at himself Boyne thought calling to mind with a
faint recoil from the reminder that he also once or twice had been vaguely afraid of himself when he had looked too long at Judith Had his eyes been like that he wondered And the muscles of his face
been stretched in the effort to detach the eyes The thing was not pleasant to visualise and he disliked Mr Dobree the more for serving as his mirror
But suddenly Mr Dobree was on his feet his whole attention given to Mrs Sellars Again Boyne followed his change of direction with a start Mrs Sellars but then she had been there all the time
Shadowed by her spreading hat her light body bedded in the turf she looked almost as young and sylvan as Judith But somehow she had been merged in the landscape all broken up into a dapple of
sun and shade of murmurs and soughings her way of fitting into things sometimes had this effect of effacing her She lifted her head and in the shade of the hat brim Boyne caught a delicate
watchfulness of brows and lips as of tiny live things under a protecting leaf
Mr Dobree was challenging her jauntily Do you see why those young cannibals should monopolise all the wild strawberries Suppose we leave Mr Boyne to mount guard over the sleeping beauty and
try to bag our share before it s too late The words said clearly enough Take me away it s high time and Mrs Sellars s gay little answer
Come on I ll show you a patch they ll never find seemed to declare as clearly I know but I ll see that you don t come to any mischief
She was on her feet before his hands could help her up something light and bounding in her seemed to spring to his call This way this way she cried starting ahead of him up the boulder strewn way
Boyne heard their voices mounting the streamside mingling with the noise of the water fading and flashing out again like the glimpses of her dress through the beech leaves He lay without moving
watching the smoke of his pipe rise in wavering spirals twisted out of shape by puffs of air from the waterfall With Mr Dobree s withdrawal the ideas suggested by his presence had gone too Judith
Wheater seemed once more a little girl Though perplexities and uncertainties still lingered on the verge of Boyne s mind his central self was anchored in a deep circle of peace Every fibre of him was
alive to the exquisite moment but he had no need to fly from it no fear of its flying from him Judith s sleep was a calm pool in which he rested
He fancied he must have been watching her for a long time his thoughts enclosing her in a sort of calm fraternal vigilance when she opened her eyes and turned them on him still dewy with sleep
Martin she hailed him drowsily then fully awake she sat up and exclaimed Darling when are you going to be married I ve positively got to know at once
She was always startling Boyne but she had perhaps never startled him more than by this question
for even as she spoke he had been half unconsciously putting it to himself He remembered as something already far off picturesque and unreal as a youthful folly his resentment of Mrs Sellars s
delay in fixing a date for their marriage Was it only two or three weeks ago that he had sent her with a basket of gentians picked on a lofty upland a quotation from Marvell s Coy Mistress Now all that
seemed an undergraduate s impatience She had taught him that they were very well as they were and if he still asked himself when they were to be married the question had imperceptibly taken another

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html form What in God s name will become of the children after we re married was the way he now
instinctively put it
He too sat up and gazed into Judith s sleepy eyes As he did so he was aware that an uncomfortable redness which did not he hoped resemble Mr Dobree s was creeping up to his temples
When I m going to be married Why What s the odds I don t know that it s anybody s business anyhow he grumbled in an ill assured voice
Judith brushed the rebuff aside Oh but it is it s mine For a very particular reason she continued as if affectionately resolved to break down the barrier of his reserve
A reason Nonsense What has a chit like you got to do with reasons You mean I m so unreasonable A quick shadow crossed her face You didn t really mean that
I didn t mean anything at all any more than you do I only meant why aren t we very well as we are
Her eyes grew wide at this and continued to fix him with a half mocking gravity while her lips rounded into a smile Oh but Martin dear it s Mrs Sellars who ought to say that not you
Boyne burst out laughing How could one ever keep serious for two minutes with any of these preposterous children And once more he told himself that Judith was as preposterous and as much
of a child as the youngest of them
You know darling you ought to be empress impatient passionate she adjured him as if his very life depended on his following her advice
He leaned on his elbow and examined her with deliberation Well of all the cheek She shook her head still smiling I m not cheeky I m really not Martin But sometimes you strike
me as having so little experience Thank you Boyne interjected
Oh I mean in those sorts of ways As if you d lived all your life so far away from the world From your world So I have thank heaven After a moment he added with severity So has Mrs
Sellars thank heaven too The girl stood up and crossing the mossy space between them dropped down beside him and laid
her hand on his arm Now I ve offended you Doll Westway always said I had no tact And all I wanted was to explain why I have to know as soon as possible when you re to be married
Well you certainly haven t explained that Boyne answered turning away from her to relight his pipe
No but I m going to And you ll be pleased It s because we ve all clubbed together even the steps and Scopy have to give you a really jolly wedding present and I think you ll like what we ve found
We unearthed it the other day at Toblach at the antiquaire s And we want to know exactly the right moment to give it to you You do love presents don t you Martin she urged as if straining her
utmost to reach some human chord in him He met the question with another laugh
Love presents I should think I did Almost as much as you do She coloured a little at the insinuation and perceiving this he hastened on It s awfully dear of you all and I m ever so grateful
But there was no need to be in such a devil of a hurry Her face became all sympathy and interrogation Oh Martin you don t mean things haven t gone
wrong have they Her look and intonation showed that she would have been genuinely distressed if they had A pang like neuralgia shot through Boyne yet a pang that was not all bitter He took her
hand and laid what she had once called a grown up kiss on it Of course not dear And thank you thank you for everything Whatever you ve all chosen for me I shall love Only you know there s
really no sort of hurry She met this in silence as something manifestly final Folding her arms behind her she let her head
droop back on them and her gaze wandered lazily skyward through the flicker of boughs

Boyne had got his pipe going again Gradually the tumult in his mind subsided He sank back lazily at her side tilting his hat over his brows and saying to himself What on earth s the use of thinking
ahead anyhow Directly in the line of his vision Judith s sandalled feet lay in a bed of bracken crossed like a resting
Mercury s He could almost see the little tufted wings at the heels For the moment his imagination was imprisoned in a circle close about them

XXI hat evening when the children weary but still jubilant had been dropped at the Pension
Rosengl h and Boyne had joined Mrs Sellars for a late dinner at the ch let the first thing that struck him was that his sapphire had reappeared on her hand
He wondered afterward how it was that he in general so unobservant of such details had noticed that she had resumed the modest stone and concluded that it was because of Judith s ridiculous crossexamination about the date of his marriage He almost suspected that baffled by his evasiveness the
pertinacious child had ended by addressing herself to Mrs Sellars and that the latter thus challenged had put on her ring But no though Judith was sometimes lacking in tact as she herself
acknowledged this indiscretion could not be imputed to her for the reason that Mrs Sellars Boyne remembered it only now had not reappeared on the scene till it was time to pack the sleepy picnickers
into the motors She and Mr Dobree had been a long time away They had apparently prolonged their walk and incidentally had failed to find the promised strawberries or else had consumed them on
the spot And on the way home Judith and Mrs Sellars had not been in the same car Why then had Mrs Sellars suddenly put on her ring Boyne would only suppose that she had decided for reasons
unknown to him to announce their engagement that night to Mr Dobree who was no doubt going to join them at dinner
The idea obscurely irritated Boyne he felt bored in advance by the neat and obvious things Mr
Dobree would consider it becoming to say Boyne s whole view of Mrs Sellars s friend had been changed by his sudden glimpse of the man who had looked out of Mr Dobree s eyes at Judith Before
that Boyne had pigeon holed him as the successful lawyer able in his profession third rate in other capacities with a methodically planned existence of which professional affairs filled the larger part
and the rest was divided up like a carefully weighed vitamin diet Mr Dobree was strong on vitamins between exercise society philanthropy and travel Now a long way off down this fair perspective a
small an almost invisible Dobree lurked and prowled staring as he had stared at Judith A sudden irritation filled Boyne at the thought of what unknown to Mrs Sellars peered and grimaced behind
her legal counsellor It was as if Mr Dobree had unconsciously evoked for him some tragic allegory of Judith s future
Where s your friend Are we waiting for him Boyne s question sounded abrupt in his own ears but was received by Mrs Sellars with her usual equanimity
Mr Dobree No we re not waiting for him He s not coming Boyne felt relieved yet vaguely baffled If Dobree wasn t coming he immediately thought why the
devil wasn t he And what was he up to instead
Chucked you for a party at the Palace I suppose I m glad he didn t drag you up there to dine with him
No I don t think he s giving a party or going to one He had letters to write and he said he was tired
This seemed to dispose of the matter and Boyne still faintly disturbed followed his betrothed to the dining table at which of late he had so seldom sat alone with her
Don t you like it better like this she asked smiling at him across the bowl of wild roses which stood between them
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html It was indeed uncommonly pleasant to be alone with her again She gratified him at the outset by
praising the behaviour of the children on the picnic and as they talked he began to think that his growing irritability and his odd reluctance to look forward to their future together had been caused
only by the intrusion of irrelevant problems and people When we re alone together everything s always all right he thought reassured
Dinner over they drifted out onto the balcony in the old way and he lit his cigar and yielded to the sense of immediate wellbeing He saw that Rose Sellars knew he was glad to be alone with her and
that the knowledge put her at her ease and made her want to say and do whatever would maintain that mood in him There was something pathetic in the proud creature s eagerness to be exactly what
he wished her to be
Judith was looking her very prettiest today wasn t she Mr Dobree was so much struck by her she said softly after a silence
It was as if she had flung a boulder into the very middle of the garden plot she had just been at such pains to lay out Boyne met the remark with an exasperated laugh
I should say he was struck That was fairly obvious Well she is striking at times Mrs Sellars conceded still more gently
As any lovely child is That s what she is a lovely child Dobree looks at her like a dog licking his jaws over a bone
Martin Sorry I never could stand your elderly men who look at little girls If your friend is so dotty about
Judith he d better ask her to marry him He s rich isn t he His money might be an inducement who knows
Marry her Marry Judith Mr Dobree Mrs Sellars gave way to a mild mirth His words certainly sounded absurd enough when she echoed them but Boyne for the moment was beyond heeding
anything but the tumult in his own veins
Why not he continued As the poor child is situated money is a big consideration What s the use of being a hypocrite about it If she s to fight her parents and keep the children together she ll need
cash and a big pile of it and a clever lawyer to man uvre for her too I call it an ideal arrangement Mrs Sellars waited a little before answering then she said I don t see how the biggest fortune and
the cleverest lawyer in the world could keep the Wheaters from ordering their children home the day they choose to But I m sure that if Judith wanted help and advice no one would be more happy to give
it to her than Mr Dobree Ah there you re right Boyne agreed with an ironic shrug
Well and don t you think perhaps it might be a good thing if she did consult him or at least if you did for her
If I intervened in any way between Dobree and Judith I don t think he d thank you for putting me up to it
Why what do you mean If you don t know what I mean I can only suppose you didn t notice how he was looking at the child
this afternoon before you carried him off for a walk Mrs Sellars fell silent again He saw the faint lines of perplexity weaving their net over her face and
reflected that when a woman is no longer young she can preserve her air of freshness only in the intervals of feeling It s too bad he thought vexed with himself for having upset the delicate balance
of her serenity But now she was smiling again a little painfully
Looking at her looking at her how Well as I ve told you
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
The smile persisted I certainly didn t see anything like that And neither did I carry him off for a walk as it happens it was he who carried me
Oh well Boyne murmured at this touch of feminine vanity
Mrs Sellars continued And I don t think he s thinking of Judith in the way you imagine or that he can have looked at her in that way I hope he didn t because as it happens he took me off on that walk
to ask me to marry him The words dropped from her with a serene detachment as if they had been her luminous little smile
made audible I don t know that it s quite fair to him to tell you she added with one of her oldfashioned impulses of reserve
It was Boyne s turn to find no answer For some time he sat gazing into the summer darkness without speaking Marry him Marry Dobree you
You see you were right he does want to get married she softly bantered It was what he came for to ask me I d no idea And now he s going away he leaves to morrow she added with a faint
sigh in which deprecation and satisfaction were perceptibly mingled If it was her little triumph she took it meekly even generously but nevertheless he saw with a complete consciousness of what it
Boyne laughed again this time at himself
I don t know what you see in it that is so absurd Mrs Sellars murmured a faint note of vexation in her voice Again he found no reply and she continued with the distant air she assumed when echoing
axioms current in her youth After all it s the highest honour a man can Oh quite Boyne agreed good humouredly He rubbed his hand across his forehead as if to brush
away some inner confusion But it was no use he couldn t straighten his thoughts out He couldn t shake off the fact that his surprise and derision had not concerned Rose Sellars at all that his laugh
had simply mocked his own power of self deception and uttered his relief at finding himself so deceived So that was all The words escaped him unawares In the dusk he felt the shadowy figure at
his side stiffen and withdraw from him
Shall we go in It s getting chilly said Mrs Sellars turning back toward the lamplight
Boyne still in the bewilderment of his own thoughts followed her into the room He noticed that she had grown unusually pale She sat down beside the table and began turning over the letters and
papers which the evening post had brought Boyne stood in front of the fireplace his hands in his pockets watching her movements as one letter after another slipped through her fingers But all he
could see was the sapphire ring re established enthroned proclaiming his own destiny to all concerned and unconcerned
So you told him you were already engaged She looked up at him It was only fair wasn t it
Certainly that is if being engaged was the only obstacle The only obstacle
If you were prepared to marry Dobree supposing you d still been free She weighed this and then laughed a little but without much gaiety How do I know what I should
have done if I d been free He continued to look at her Do you want to try
The colour rose to her forehead She dropped the letters and composed her hands on them as if in the effort to control a secret agitation Is this a way of telling me you re vexed because I announced
our engagement to Mr Dobree He hesitated feeling and now he hated himself for feeling that it was a moment for going warily
Not vexed that s not the word Only I did agree with you that as long as as nothing about our future
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html was definitely settled it was ever so much pleasanter keeping our private affairs to ourselves It was
your own idea you know you proposed it he reminded her as she remained silent
Yes it was my idea She pondered But you needn t be afraid that Mr Dobree will betray us It s not a question of betraying It s just the feeling
The feeling that some one else is in our secret But all the Wheater children have been for a long time She spoke the words ever so lightly as if she had barely pencilled them on a smooth page
Boyne was startled He could see no analogy but did not know how to explain that there was none
Oh the children but the children don t count Besides that wasn t my fault Judith guessed He smiled a little at the reminiscence But perhaps Mr Dobree guessed he added with a return of ease
After all he was carrying it off very well he thought though what he meant by it he would have been put to it to say
Mrs Sellars gave another little laugh Oh no Mr Dobree didn t guess I had to dot the i s for him
The fact is she paused a moment he was convinced that you were in love with Judith Wheater Instantly all the resentments and suspicions which Boyne had dismissed rushed back on him He
had been right then he had not mistaken the signs and portents As if they were ever mistakable
How rotten he said in a low voice
Mrs Sellars dropped one of the letters which she had absently taken up again
Martin Rotten The mere thinking of such a thing much less insinuating it to any one else But it just
shows He broke off and then began again on a fresh wave of indignation Shows what kind of a mind he must have Thinking in that way about a child a mere child and about any man any decent
man regarding it as possible perhaps as natural worst of all suggesting it of some one standing in my position toward these children as if I might take advantage of my opportunities to to fall in love
with a child in the schoolroom Boyne s words sounded in his own ears as if they were being megaphoned at him across the width of
the room He dropped down into the nearest chair hot angry ashamed with a throat as dry as if he had been haranguing an open air meeting on a dusty day
Opposite him Mrs Sellars remained with her hands suspended above the letters The sapphire burned at him across the interval Martin but you are in love with her she exclaimed She paused
a moment and then added in a quieter voice I believe I ve always known it They sat and looked at each other without speaking
At length Boyne rose and started to move around the table to where she was sitting
This is ridiculous he began
She held up her hand and the gesture though evidently meant only to check the words on his lips had the effect also of arresting his advance He felt self conscious and clumsy and dimly resented her
making him feel so He was sure it was she who had been ridiculous not he yet curiously enough the conviction brought him no solace Again they faced each other guardedly apprehensively as if
something fragile and precious which they had been carrying together had slipped between their fingers and been broken He felt that if he glanced at the floor he might see the glittering fragments
Mrs Sellars was the first to recover her self possession She rose in her turn and going up to Boyne laid her hand on his arm
I wonder why we re trying to hurt each other She looked at him through moist lashes and he felt himself a brute for not instantly taking her in his arms and obliterating their discussion with a kiss
But there lay the glittering fragments and he could not seem to reach to her across them
Now I know what she thinks of Judith he reflected savagely
It s all my fault Martin I know I m nervous and stupid She was clasping his arm pleading with lifted eyes and lips Her self abasement humiliated him If she really thinks what she says why
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html doesn t she kick me out he wondered
I suppose I walked too far today and got over tired and what Mr Dobree said startled me upset me
He smiled His asking you to marry him She smiled back a little wearily No But what he said about about your interest in Judith You
must understand dear that sometimes your attitude about those children is a little surprising to people who don t know all the circumstances
Boyne felt himself hardening again What business is it of people who don t know all the circumstances You do that s enough
She seized at this with a distressing humility Of course I do dearest of course it is And you ll try to forget my stupid nerves won t you Try to think of me as I am when there s nobody in the world but
you and me Her arms stole up to his shoulders her hands met behind his neck and she drew his head down softly If only it could always be like that
As their lips touched he shut his eyes and tried with a violent effort of the will to recall what her kiss would have meant to him on the far off day when the news of Sellars s death had overtaken him
somewhere in the Nubian desert and in the middle of the night he had started awake still clutching the letter and crying out to himself At last
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
ext day when Boyne thought over the scene of the previous night he found for it all the excuses which occur to a sensible man in the glow of his morning bath
It was all the result of idling and lack of hard exercise when a working man has had too long a holiday and resting has become dawdling Satan proverbially intervenes But though at first Boyne
assumed all the blame by the time he began to shave he had handed over a part to Mrs Sellars After all it was because of her old fashioned scruples her unwillingness to marry him at once and let him
get back to work that they were still loitering in the Dolomites It probably wasn t safe for middle aged people to have too much leisure in which to weigh each other s faults and merits
But then again suddenly he thought If we d been married and gone home when I wanted to what would have become of the children It was undoubtedly because Mrs Sellars had insisted on
prolonging their engagement that Boyne had become involved in the Wheater problem but when he reached this point in his retrospect he found he could not preserve his impartiality It was impossible
to face the thought of what might have happened to the little Wheaters if chance had not put him in their way
After all then everything was for the best All he had to do was to persuade Mrs Sellars of it which ought not to be difficult since it was a best of her own devising and to banish from his mind the
disturbing figure of Mr Dobree Perhaps on second thoughts his irritability of the previous evening had been partly due to the suspicion that Mrs Sellars for all her affected indifference was flattered by
Mr Dobree s proposal You never can tell Boyne concluded and shrugged that possibility away too The thought that he might have had to desert his young friends in their hour of distress and had
been able instead to stay and help them effaced all other considerations So successfully did he talk himself over to this view that only one cloud remained on his horizon Mrs Sellars had said I don t
see how the biggest fortune and the cleverest lawyer in the world could keep the Wheaters from ordering their children home the day they choose to and in saying it she had put her finger on
Boyne s inmost apprehension He had told himself the same thing a hundred times but to hear it from any one else made the danger seem more pressing It reminded him that the little Wheaters hold on
him was not half as frail as his own on them and that it was folly to indulge the illusion that he could really direct or control their fate
Well he could only mark time thank heaven it was still his to mark The Lido season had not yet reached its climax and till it declined and fell he was free to suppose that its devotees would linger on
hypnotized As between taking steps for an immediate divorce and figuring to the last in the daily round of entertainment Boyne felt sure that not one of the persons concerned would hesitate They
could settle questions of business afterward and it was purely as business that they regarded a matter in which the extent of the alimony was always the chief point of debate And what could replace the
excitement of a Longhi ball at the Fenice or of a Marriage of the Doge to the Adriatic mimed in a reconstituted Bucentaur by the rank and fashion of half Europe No one would be leaving Venice yet
But all the same the days were flying The increasing number of arrivals at Cortina the growing throng of motors on all the mountain ways showed that before long fashion would be moving from the
seashore to the mountains and when the Lido broke up what might not break up with it Boyne felt that the question must at last be faced that he must have a talk about it that very day with Judith
It was more than a month since Judith and her flock had appeared at Cortina and the various parents concerned had promised Boyne that the children should be left in the Dolomites till the
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html summer was over But what was such a promise worth and what did the phrase mean on lips so
regardless of the seasons Nothing Boyne knew it He was conscious now that during the last four weeks he had never gone down to the Pension Rosengl h without expecting to be told that a summons
or a command had come from the Lido But so far there had been none The children were protected by the fact that there was no telephone at the pension and that none of their parents was capable
except under the most extreme pressure of writing a letter
When it was impossible to telephone they could indeed telegraph but even the inditing of a telegram required a concentration of mind which Boyne knew would become increasingly difficult as
the Lido season culminated Telegrams did of course come especially in the first days both to Boyne and to Judith long messages from Joyce about clothes and diet rambling communications from Lady
Wrench setting forth her rights and grievances in terms which by the time they had passed through two Italian telegraph offices were as confused as the thoughts in her own mind and lastly a curt wire
from Cliffe Wheater to Boyne Wish it definitely understood relinquish no rights whatever how is Chipstone reply paid
To all these communications Boyne returned a comprehensive All right and acting on his advice Judith did the same merely adding particulars as to the children s health and happiness On the
whole you know she explained to Boyne it s a relief to them all now the thing s settled I always knew it would be She and Terry still cherished the hope that in the autumn she would be permitted to
take the children out to Grandma Mervin in America or that failing permission she would be encouraged by Boyne to carry them off secretly With this in view she and Miss Scope saved up every
penny they could of the allowance which Cliffe Wheater had agreed to make and which Boyne dealt out to them once a week But all these arrangements were so precarious so dependent on the moods of
unreasonable and uncertain people that it seemed a miracle that the little party at the Pension Rosengl h was still undisturbed Certainly if it had been possible to reach them by telephone they
would have been scattered long ago As soon as they break up at the Lido they ll be after you Boyne had warned Judith from the first but she had always answered hopefully Oh no not till after Cowes
if they still go there and if they don t after Venice there s Biarritz You ll see And before Biarritz there s a fortnight in Paris for autumn clothes
Cowes in due course had been relinquished the Lido exerting too strong a counter attraction but after a few more weeks that show also would be packed away in the lumber room of spent follies
The fact of having these questions always on his mind kept Boyne from being unduly disturbed by his discussion of the previous evening with Mrs Sellars In the wholesome light of morning a
sentimental flurry between two sensible people who were deeply attached to each other seemed as nothing compared to the ugly reality perpetually hanging over the little Wheaters and he felt sure that
Mrs Sellars would take the same view
She did not disappoint him When he presented himself at the luncheon hour the very air of the little sitting room breathed a new serenity it was as if she had been out early to fill it with flowers Boyne
was not used to delicate readjustments in his sentimental relations For so many years now his feeling for Rose Sellars had been something apart like a beautiful picture on the wall of a quiet room and his
other amorous episodes had been too brief and simple for any great amount of man uvring He was therefore completely reassured by the gaiety and simplicity of her welcome and thought to himself
once again that there was everything to be said in favour of a long social acquiescence A stupid woman now would insist on going over the whole thing again like a blue bottle that starts in banging
about the room after you re sure you ve driven it out of the window There was nothing of the blue bottle about Mrs Sellars and she was timorously anxious that Boyne
should know it But her timidity was not base if she submitted she submitted proudly The only sign she gave of a latent embarrassment was in her too great ease her too blithe determination to deny it
But even this was minimised by the happy fact that she had a piece of news for him
She did not tell him what it was till lunch was over and they were finishing their coffee in the sitting room she knew the importance of not disturbing a man s train of thought even agreeably
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html while he is in the act of enjoying good food Boyne had lit his cigar and was meditating on the uniform
excellence of the coffee she managed to give him when she said with a little laugh Only imagine Aunt Julia s on the Atlantic I had a radio this morning She says she s coming over to Paris to see
you Boyne had pictured Aunt Julia when he could spare the time for such an evocation as something
solid ponderous essentially immovable She represented for him the obstinate stability of old New York in the flux of new experiments It was like being told that Trinity Church for instance was taking
a Loretto flight across the Atlantic to see him
Mrs Sellars laughed at his incredulous stare Are you surprised I m not You see Aunt Julia was always the delicate sister the one who had to be nursed Aunt Gertrude the strong one who did the
nursing died last winter and since then Aunt Julia s been perfectly well They agreed that such resurrections were not uncommon and Mrs Sellars went so far as to declare
that if she didn t get to Paris in time to meet Aunt Julia she was prepared to have the latter charter an aeroplane and descend on Cortina Indeed we re only protected by the fact that I don t believe there s
any landing field in the Dolomites She went on to say that she would have to leave in a day or two as Aunt Julia who was accustomed
to having her path smoothed for her had requested that hotel rooms fulfilling all her somewhat complicated requirements should be made ready for her arrival a six cylinder motor with balloon tires
and an irreproachable chauffeur engaged to meet her at the station and a doctor and a masseuse be found in attendance when she arrived as a result of which precautions she hoped after an interval of
repose to be well enough to occupy herself with her niece s plans
Boyne gasped Good Lord what that cable must have cost her Oh it s not the cost that ever bothers Aunt Julia said Aunt Julia s niece with a certain deference
Boyne laughed and agreed that Mrs Sellars could not prudently refuse such a summons Somehow it no longer offended him that she should obey it from motives so obviously interested He could not
have said why but it now seemed to him natural enough that she should hold herself at the disposal of a rich old aunt He wondered whether it was because her departure would serve to relieve a passing
tension but he dismissed this as a bit of idle casuistry The point is that she s going and that she and I will probably be awfully glad to see each other when she gets back
Mrs Sellars cast a wistful look about her After a pause she said You don t know how I hate to think that our good evenings in this dear little room are so nearly over in a tone suggesting that she
had rather expected Boyne to say it for her and that he had somehow missed a cue
But why over Not for more than a week I hope You re not going to let yourself be permanently annexed by Aunt Julia
She smiled a little perplexedly evidently other plans were in her mind plans she had pictured him as instinctively divining Not permanently but I don t quite know when I shall be able to leave her
Oh I say my dear The perplexity lifted from her smile it seemed to reach out to him like a promise But then I expect
you to join me very soon As soon as Aunt Julia s blood pressure has been taken and the doctor and the masseuse and the chauffeur have been tested and passed upon
Boyne listened in astonishment It had never seriously occurred to him that he was to be involved in the ceremony of establishing Aunt Julia on European soil Oh but look here what earthly use should
I be Why should I be butchered to make Aunt Julia s holiday You won t be It will be almost the other way round I m going to do everything I possibly can for
Aunt Julia everything to start her successfully on her European adventure And then I m going to present the bill
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She nodded gaily You re the bill I m going to present you and say Now you ve seen him can you
wonder that I mean to marry him at once whether you like it or not The words fell on a silence which Boyne for the moment found it impossible to break Mrs Sellars
stood by her writing table her slender body leaning to him her face lit with one of those gleams of lost youth which he had once found so exquisite and poignant He found it so now but with another
You mean you mean you ve changed your mind about the date He broke off the words of our marriage choking on his lips Through a mist of bewilderment he saw the tender mockery of her
smile and knew how much courage it disguised I stand here like a stock what a brute she ll think me
Did you imagine I was one of the dreadful women who never change their minds She came close clasped her hands about his arm lifted her delicate face still alight with expectation The face said
Here I am to be cherished or shattered and he thought again of the glittering fragments he had seen at his feet the night before He detached her hands and lifted them one after another to his kiss
If only some word if only the right word would come to him
Martin don t you want me to change my mind she suddenly challenged him He held her hands against his breast caressing them
Dear first of all I don t want to be the cause of you doing anything that might offend your aunt
that might interfere in any way with her views No he couldn t go on the words strangled him
He was too sure that she was aware they did not express what he was thinking were spoken only to gain time
But with a gentle tenacity she pursued It s awfully generous of you to think of that But don t you suppose dear I ve been miserable at asking you to linger on here when I ve always known that what
you wanted was to be married at once and get back to work I ve been imprisoned in my past I see it now I had become the slave of all those years of conformity you used to reproach me with For a long
time I couldn t get out of their shadow But you ve opened my eyes you ve set me free How monstrous to have waited so long for happiness and then to be afraid to seize it when it comes Her
arms stole up and drew him I m not afraid now Martin You ve taught me not to be Henceforth I mean to think of you first not of Aunt Julia I mean to marry you as soon as it can be done I don t
suppose the formalities take very long in Paris do they Then as soon as we re married we ll sail for home
He listened in a kind of stupor saying inwardly It s not that I love her less it can t be that I love her less It s only that everything that happens between us always seems to happen at the wrong time
The silence prolonged itself on her side stretched and straining on his built up like a wall opaque impenetrable From beyond it came her little far off laugh Dear I m utterly in your hands you see
Evidently there had to be an answer to that Rose he began Pretty as her name was he hardly ever called her by it he had always felt her too close to him to need a name She looked up in surprise
He made a fresh start But you see darling how things are A little tremor ran across her face What things
You know that after you d refused to consider the possibility of our getting married at once I pledged myself
The tremor ceased and her face once more became smooth and impenetrable He found himself repeating to vacancy I pledged myself
She drew quietly away and sat down at a little distance from him You re talking about your odd experiment with the Wheater children
It s more than an experiment When I saw the parents in Venice I told them as you know that I d be responsible for the welfare of the children as long as they were left with me
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html As long as they were left with you For life perhaps then She leaned forward her face drawn
with the valiant effort of her smile Martin Is all this serious It can t be You can t really be asking me to understand that all our plans our whole future yours and mine are to depend for an
indefinite length of time on the whim of two or three chance acquaintances of yours who are too heartless and self engrossed to look after their own children
Boyne paused a moment then he said We had no plans I mean no immediate plans when I entered into the arrangement It was by your own choice that
My own choice Well then my own choice now is that we should have plans immediately She stood up trembling a little She was very pale and her thin eyebrows drew a straight black bar across
her forehead Martin I ask you to come with me at once to Paris At once But just now you said in a week or two
And now I say at once to morrow He stood leaning against the chimney as far from her as the little room allowed A tide of resistance
rose in him I can t come to morrow He was conscious that she was making an intense effort to steady her quivering nerves Martin I
don t want to be unreasonable You re never unreasonable he said patiently
You mean it might have been better if I were she flashed back crimsoning
Don t be now he pleaded
No She paused Very well Come to Paris in a few days then Look here dear all this is of no use No earthly use I can t come in a few days any more than I can
come to morrow I can t desert these children till their future is settled in one way or another I ve said I d stick to them and I mean to If I turned my back on them now they d lose their last chance of being
able to stay together She received this with bent head and hands clasped stiffly across her knee but suddenly her selfcontrol broke down But Martin are you mad What business is it of yours anyhow what becomes of
these children I don t know he said simply
You don t know you don t know No I only feel it s got to be I m pledged I can t get round it
You can t get round it because you don t want to You re pledged because you want to be You want to be because Mr Dobree was right because
Rose take care he interrupted very low
Take care At this hour Of what For whom All I care for is to know the truth I m telling you the truth
You may think you are But the truth is something very different something you re not conscious of yourself perhaps not clearly
I believe I m telling you the whole truth That when I ask you to choose between me and the Wheater children you choose the Wheater
children out of philanthropy I didn t say out of philanthropy I said I didn t know
If you don t know I do You re in love with Judith Wheater and you re trying to persuade yourself that you re still in love with me
He lifted his hands to his face and covered his eyes as if from some intolerable vision she had summoned to them Don t Rose for the Lord s sake Don t let s say stupid things

But dear I must She got up and came close to him again he felt her hands on his arm Listen Martin I love you too much not to want to help you Try to feel that about me won t you Then
everything will be so much easier Yes
Try to understand your own feelings that s the best way of sparing mine I want the truth that s all Try to see the truth and face it with me it s all I ask
He dropped his hands and turned his discouraged eyes on her But he could only feel that he and she were farther apart than when he had last looked at her all the rest was confusion and obscurity
I don t know what the truth as you call it is I swear I don t but I know it s not what you think
Judith s as much a child to me as the others that I swear to you Then dear
Then I ve got to stick to them all the same he repeated doggedly
For a time the two continued to stand in silence with eyes averted like people straining to catch some far off sound which will signal relief from a pressing peril Then slowly Boyne turned to Mrs
Sellars His eyes rested on her profile so thin drawn bloodless that a fresh pang shot through him
He had often mocked at himself as a man who in spite of all his wanderings had never had a real adventure but now he saw that he himself had been one had been Rose Sellars s Great Adventure the
risk and the enchantment of her life While she had continued during the weary years of her marriage to be blameless exemplary patient and heroically gay the thought of Boyne was storing up treasures
for her which she would one day put out her hand and take no matter how long she might have to wait Her patience Boyne knew was endless it was as long as her hair She had trained herself to go
on waiting for happiness day after day month after month year after year with the same air of bright unruffled vigilance like a tireless animal waiting for its prey One day her prey her happiness would
appear and she would snap it up and on that day there would be no escape from her
It was terrible it was hideous to be picturing her distress as something grasping and predatory it was more painful still to be entering so acutely into her feelings while a central numbness paralysed
his own All around this numbness there was a great margin of pity and of comprehension but he knew this was not the region by way of which he could reach her She who had always lived the life of
reason would never forgive him if he called upon her reason now
Rose he appealed to her
She turned and he saw her face composed remodelled suffused with a brilliancy like winter starlight Her lips formed a smiling Dear
Rose She took his hand with the lightest pressure Dearest what utter nonsense we ve both been talking
Of course I don t mean that you re to desert the Wheater children for me and of course you don t mean that you re to desert me for them do you I believe I understand all you feel all your fondness
for the poor little things I should shiver at you if you hadn t grown to love them But you and I have managed to get each other all on edge I don t know how Don t you feel what a mistake it would be to
go in and out of this question any longer I have an idea I could find a solution almost at once if only I weren t trying to so hard And so could you no doubt She paused a little breathlessly and then
resumed her eager monologue Let s say goodbye till to morrow shall we and produce our respective plans of action when we meet again And don t forget that the problem may solve itself
without regard to us and at any minute She had caught at the last splinter of the rock of Reason still visible above the flood and there she
clung dauntless unbeaten uttering the right the impartial word with lips that pined and withered for his kiss
Oh my dear he murmured

Before he could take her in his arms she had slipped out of reach and softly adroitly closed the door on him Alone on the landing he was left with the sense that that deft gesture had shut him up with her

t was growing more and more evident to Boyne that he could recover his old vision of Mrs Sellars only when they were apart He began to think this must be due to his having loved her so long from
a distance having somehow in consequence of their separation established with her an ideal relation to which her slightest misapprehension her least failure to say just what he expected was a recurring
At first the surprise of finding her after his long absence so much younger and more vivid than his remembrance the glow of long imagined caresses the whole enchanting harmony of her presence
had hushed the inner discord But though she was dearer to him than ever all free communication seemed to have ceased between them he could regain it only during those imaginary conversations in
which it was he who sustained both sides of the dialogue
This was what happened when he had walked off the pain and bewilderment of their last talk For two hours he tramped the heights unhappy confused struggling between the sense of her
unreasonableness and of his own predicament then gradually there stole back on him the serenity always associated with the silent sessions of his thought and hers On what seemed to him the
fundamental issues questions of fairness kindness human charity in the widest meaning when had she ever failed him in these wordless talks His position with regard to the Wheater children hadn t
he admitted it to her was unreasonable indefensible was whatever else she chose to call it yes but it was also human and that would touch her in the end He had no doubt that when they met the next
day she would have her little solution ready and be prepared to smile with him over their needless perturbation
The thought of her deep submissive passion which contrasted so sharply with his own uneasy selfassertiveness was the only anxiety that remained with him He knew now how much she loved him but did he know how much he loved her Supposing for instance that on getting back to his hotel
now this very evening he should find a line telling him that she had decided for both their sakes to break their engagement well could he honestly say that it would darken earth and heaven for him
Mortified hurt at a loose end all this he would be already the tender flesh of his vanity was shrinking and under it he felt the thrust of wounded affection But that was all in the balance how
He got back late to the hotel and walked unheedingly past the letter rack toward which at that hour it was usual to glance for the evening mail The porter called to him waving a letter The
envelope bore the New York post mark and in the upper corner Boyne recognised the name of the big firm of contracting engineers to whom he had owed some of his most important jobs They still wrote
now and then to consult him no doubt this letter which had been forwarded by his London bankers was of that nature He pushed it into his pocket deciding to read it after he had dined And then he
proceeded to dine alone in a corner of the unfashionable restaurant of his hotel of which the tables with their thick crockery and clumsy water carafes seemed like homely fragments of a recentlydisjoined table d h te the long old fashioned hotel table at which travellers used to be seated in his
parents day A coarse roll lay by his plate the table bore a bunch of half faded purply pink cosmos in an opaque blue vase everything about him was ugly and impersonal yet he hugged himself for not
being at the ch let table with its air of exquisite rusticity its bowl of cunningly disposed wild flowers the shaded candles the amusing food Yes and he was glad too not to be sharing the little Wheaters
pudding at the Pension Rosengl h he was suddenly aware of an intense unexpected satisfaction in being for once alone his own master with no one that he need be on his guard against or at his best
before no one to be tormented or enchanted by no one to listen to and answer Decidedly I m a

savage he thought emptying his plateful of savourless soup with an appetite he was almost ashamed of The moral of it obviously was that he had been idle too long that what he was thirsting for at this
very moment was not more rest but more work and that the idea of giving up his life of rough and toilsome activity for the security of an office in New York as he had aspired to do a few short months
ago now seemed intolerable Too old for the fatigue and hardships of an engineer s life Why it was the fatigues and the hardships which physically speaking had given the work its zest just as the
delicate mathematical calculations had provided its intellectual stimulus The combination of two such sources of interest so rare in other professions was apparently what he needed to keep him straight
curb his excitable imagination discipline his nerves and make him wake up every morning to a steady imperturbable view of life After dinner sitting in the dreary little lounge as he lit his pipe and pulled
the letter from his pocket he thought I wish to God it was an order to start for Tierra del Fuego It was nothing of the sort of course merely an inquiry for the address of a young engineer who had
been Boyne s assistant a few years earlier and whom the firm in question had lost sight of They had been struck with Boyne s estimate of the young man s ability and thought they might have an
interesting piece of work for him if he happened to be available and was not scared by hardships and responsibility Boyne put the letter into his pocket leaned back in his chair and thought God I wish
I was his age and just starting for anywhere His mind turned round and round this thought for the rest of the evening Perhaps he could make
Mrs Sellars understand that after all he had made a mistake in supposing he had reached the age for sedentary labours Once they were married she would surely see that for his soul s sake and until the
remainder of his youth was used up she must let him go off on these remote exciting expeditions which seemed the only cure for for what Well for the creeping grayness of age no doubt The fear of
that must be what ailed him At any rate he must get away he must As soon as the fate of the little Wheaters was decided and he and Rose were married and he had established her in New York he
must get back into the glorious soul releasing world of girders and abutments of working stresses curvatures and grades
She had talked of having her little plan ready for him the next day Well he would have one for her at any rate this big comprehensive one First the Wheater tribe transplanted he didn t yet see how
to the safe shelter of Grandma Mervin s wing then his own marriage then flight He worked himself into a glow of eloquence as he always did in these one sided talks which never failed to end in
convincing Mrs Sellars because he unconsciously eliminated from them all the objections she might possibly have raised He went to bed with a sense of fresh air in his soul as if the mere vision of
escape had freed him
Mrs Sellars had not said at what hour she expected him the next day so he decided to wait till lunch and drop in on her then as his habit was when they had no particular expedition in view In the
morning he usually strolled down to see how the Rosengl h refugees were getting on but on this occasion he left them to themselves and did not go out till he made for the ch let As he approached it
he was startled by a queer sense of something impending Oh not another scene Rose was much too intelligent for that What he felt was just an uneasy qualm as if the new air in his soul s lungs were
being gradually pumped out of them again He glanced up at the balcony lifting his hand to signal to her but she was not there He pushed open the hall door and ran up the short flight of stairs The little
sitting room was empty it looked speckless and orderly as a tomb He noticed at once that the littered writing table was swept and garnished and that no scent of viands greeted him through the diningroom door
She had gone he became suddenly sure that she had gone But why But when Above all why without a word It was so unlike her to do anything abrupt and unaccountable that his vague sense of
apprehension returned

He sat down in the armchair he always occupied as if the familiar act must re evoke her call her back into the seat opposite in the spirit if not in the flesh But the room remained disconcertingly
remained even spiritually empty He had the sense that she had gone indeed and had taken her soul with her and the discovery made a queer unexpected void in him This is absurd he heard himself
Rose he called out there was no answer He stood up and his wandering eye travelled from the table to the mantelpiece On its shelf he saw a letter addressed to himself He seized it and tore it open
and all at once the accents of the writer s reasonableness floated out into the jangled air of the little room
Dearest After you left yesterday I had a radio from Aunt Julia asking me to get to Paris as soon as I could so I decided to motor over to Padua this morning and catch the Orient Express And I mean to slip off like this
without seeing you or even letting you know that I m going because on second thoughts I believe my little plan you know I promised you one will be all the better for a day or two more of quiet thought so I ll simply write it
to you from Paris instead of talking it to you hurriedly this morning
Besides I ll confess I want to keep the picture of our happiness here intact not frayed and rubbed by more discussion even the friendliest You ll understand I know This being together has been something so complete
so exquisite that I want to carry it away with me in its perfection I ll write in a few days Till then if you can think of me as I think of you No heart could ask more of another Rose
He sat down again and read the letter over two or three times It was sweet and reasonable but it was also desperately sad Yes she had understood that for a time it was best for both that they should
be apart And this was her way of putting it to him His eyes filled and he wondered how he could have thought the night before that if he suddenly heard she was leaving it would be a relief
But presently he began to visualise what the day would have been if he had found her there and they had now been sitting over the lunch table fraying and rubbing their happiness as she had put it by
more discussion useless discussion How intelligent of her to go how merciful Yes he would think of her as she thought of him he could now without a shadow of reserve He would bless her in all
honesty for this respite
He took a fading mountain pink from one of the vases on the mantelpiece put it in his pocket book with her letter and started to walk down to the village to send her a telegram As he walked he
composed it affectionately lingeringly He moved fast through the brisk air and by the time he had reached the foot of the hill a pang of wholesome hunger reminded him that he had not lunched
Straight ahead the Pension Rosengl h lay in his path and he knew that even if the little Wheaters had finished their midday meal Miss Scope would persuade the cook to conjure up an omelette for
Instantly he felt a sort of boyish excitement at the idea of surprising the party and finding the front door unlatched he crossed the hall and entered the private dining room which had been assigned to
them since the arrival of adult boarders less partial than himself to what Judith called the children s dinner roar
His appearance was welcomed with a vocal vigour which must have made the crockery dance even in the grown up Speise saal across the hall Have the wild animals left a morsel for me he asked and
gaily wedged himself in between Judith and Blanca

XXIV ninterrupted communion with the little Wheaters always gave Boyne the same feeling of
liberation It was like getting back from a constrained bodily position into a natural one This sense of being himself being simply and utterly at his ease which the children s companionship had
given him during the Mediterranean voyage but which he had enjoyed only in uncertain snatches since their arrival at Cortina came back to him as soon as he had slipped his chair between Judith s
and Blanca s at the lunch table He would not ascribe it to her having gone but preferred to think it was because her going left him free to dispose of himself as he chose And what he chose was on the
spot to resume his half fatherly attitude toward the group and devote every moment of his time to them
Being with them again was like getting home after a long and precarious journey during which he had been without news of the people he loved A great many things must have happened in the
interval and not a moment must be lost in gathering up the threads There were in fact many threads to be gathered He got a general outline of the situation that very evening from Miss Scope learned
that Terry s health was steadily improving that the young Swiss tutor whom Boyne had unearthed at Botzen was conscientious and kind and got on well with Terry but found Bun hopelessly
unmanageable And nothing new in that Miss Scope commented that on the whole the three little girls Blanca Zinnie and Beechy though trying at times were behaving better than could have been
hoped considering the unusual length of their holiday and lastly that Chipstone even in the process of cutting a new tooth retained his rosy serenity and had added a pound or more to his weight
All this was as absorbing to Boyne as if every one concerned had been of the highest interest and consequence He had a long talk with the tutor went carefully into the question of Terry s studies
suggested a few changes and encouraged and counselled the young man As to luring or coercing Bun up the steep way of knowledge a stronger hand would be needed and while Bun ranged unchecked
there was not much to be done with the little girls Even Blanca though she felt herself so superior in age and culture found the company of her juniors tolerable and their bad example irresistible when
there was nothing better going But as against these drawbacks there was the happy fact that the high air which had done all the children good had transformed Terry from a partial invalid into a joyous
active boy who laughed at temperatures and clamoured for second helpings And so far the Lido had refrained from interfering On the whole therefore as the weeks passed Boyne had more and more
reason to be satisfied with his achievement To give the children a couple of months of security with the growing hope of keeping them all together under old Mrs Mervin s roof had assuredly been worth
trying for The evening after Mrs Sellars s departure he wrote a long letter to Grandma Mervin
Boyne once more alone with the children found that his confused feeling about Judith had given way to the frank elder brotherly affection he had felt for her on the cruise Perhaps because she herself
had become natural and simple now that there were no older people to put her on the defensive she seemed again the buoyant child who had first captivated him Or perhaps his thinking so was just a
part of his satisfaction at being with his flock again unobserved and uncriticised by the grown up He and they understood each other he suspected that even had their plight not roused his pity his own
restlessness and impulsiveness would have fraternized with theirs The fact is we re none of us grown up he reflected hugging himself for being on the children s side of the eternal barrier
His talks with Judith turned as usual on the future of the children He sometimes tried to draw from her the expression of a personal preference but she seemed to want nothing for herself she
could not detach herself even in imagination from the others For them she had fabulous dreams and ambitions If only they could keep together till they were grown up She had a quaint vision of their all

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html living in a house somewhere in the country perhaps her father would buy them one when she came of
age a house which should be always full of pets and birds and leading there a life in which the amusements of the nursery were delightfully combined with grown up pursuits And for each of the
children she had thought out a definite career Blanca of course was to be lovely to Judith loveliness was a vocation Terry was to be a great scholar the guide and counsellor of the others she
had a savage reverence for the wisdom and authority to be acquired from books Bun was manifestly meant to drive racing motors and carry off championships in games and athletics Beechy would
marry and have heaps of children yet somehow be always able to look after Bun and Zinnie well Zinnie was undoubtedly predestined to be clever a fate of dubious import But Judith hoped it
would not be with the sharp cunning of little Pixie Lullmer who seemed so childish and simple and was really an abyss of precocious knowledge initiated into all the secrets of hotel life a toad of a child
Judith summed it up whereas her poor half sister Doll Westway had hated it all so much that she had taken the shortest way out by shooting herself
Ah and Chipstone Well there was no hurry about Chipstone was there But he was so large and calm and so certain to get what he wanted that Judith thought perhaps he would be a banker and
own a big yacht and take them all on wonderful cruises And Nanny and Susan would of course always stay with them to look after Beechy s children
Boyne had decided to write to old Mrs Mervin without mentioning the fact to Judith He had meant to consult her had even intended to have a talk with her on the day when Mrs Sellars s abrupt
departure had momentarily unsettled his plans but when the idea recurred to him Judith was already re established in his mind as the blithe creature of their first encounter and he had a superstitious
dread of doing anything to change the harmony of their relation After all he could plead the children s cause with their grandmother as well as Judith could and if his appeal were doomed to failure she
need never know it had been made He found himself insisting rather elaborately in his own mind on the childishness he was fond of ascribing to her when he talked of her to others and now he feared lest
anything should break through that necessary illusion In his letter to Mrs Mervin he tried to combine the maximum of conciseness and of eloquence and ended by reminding her that the various parents
might intervene at any moment and begging her to cable at once if as he earnestly hoped she could give her assent to the plan The sending off of the letter was like handing in an essay at school with its
completion he seemed entering with the children on a new holiday Two or three weeks respite anyhow and then he thought who knows I may be able to carry them all back to New York with
me Incredible as it was he clung to the hope with a faith as childish as Judith s
Mrs Sellars had said that she would write in a few days Instead she telegraphed to announce her arrival in Paris and again a little later to inform Boyne of Aunt Julia s To each message she added a
few words of tender greeting but ten days or more elapsed before the telegrams were followed by a letter
Boyne found it one evening on his return from a long expedition with the children He had ceased after a day or two to speculate on Mrs Sellars s silence had gradually as the days passed become
unconscious of their flight and was almost surprised when he saw her handwriting that a letter from Paris should have reached Cortina so quickly He waited till after dinner to read it secretly wishing to
keep the flavour of the present on his lips Then when the task could no longer be postponed he withdrew to the melancholy lounge and settled himself in the same slippery chair in which he had sat
when he read the letter of the engineers asking if he could trace the whereabouts of the young man to whom they wanted to offer a job It s to say she s coming back he muttered to himself as he broke
the seal But Mrs Sellars did not say that
The letter was one of her best tender gay and amusing The description of Aunt Julia s arrival was a little masterpiece The writer dwelt at length on the arts she had exercised was still exercising to
persuade the family tyrant that he Boyne was justified in wishing for an immediate marriage and she added on a note of modest triumph that success was already in sight But even if it were not dear

carry me off under Aunt Julia s nose formidable though that feature is if she should refuse her sanction But she won t and the important question is what we intend to do and not what she may
think about it At this stage Boyne laid the letter aside took out a cigar cut it and put it down without
remembering to light it He took up the letter again
But it s more important still that we should come to a clear understanding about our future isn t it dearest I feel that I made such an understanding impossible the other day by my
unreasonableness my impatience my apparent inability to see your point of view But I did see it even then and I see it much more clearly now that I have studied the question at a sufficient distance
to focus it properly Of course we both know that whatever decision we reach some of the numerous papas and mammas of your little friends may upset it at a moment s notice but meanwhile I have a
plan to propose What you want isn t it is to guard these poor children as long as possible from the unsettling and demoralising influence of continual change I quite see your idea and it seems to me
that those most exposed to such risks are the ones we ought to try to help By your own showing Mr
Wheater will never give up Chipstone for long Zinnie and Prince Buondelmonte s funny little pair are bound to be claimed by their respective parents now that they have settled down to wealth and
domesticity As for the enchanting Judith though you persist in not seeing it she will be grown up and married in a year or two and meanwhile if the Wheaters do divorce she will probably choose to
remain with her mother as she did before The twins in fact seem to me the chief victims They are old enough to understand what is going on and not old enough to make themselves lives of their own
and above all they are at an age when disintegrating influences are likely to do the most harm You have often told me that poor Terry s health has been an obstacle between him and his father what a
horrible idea that it should be so and that the bouncing Chip has cut him out Terry needs care and sympathy more than any of them and I am sure you will feel as I do that it would be unthinkable to
separate dear little Blanca from the brother she adores What I propose then is that you should ask Mr and Mrs Wheater to give up the twins regarding us in any capacity you like either as their
friends or as their legal guardians if that is better till they come of age I will gladly take a share in looking after them and I believe that between us we can turn them into happy useful members of
society If you agree I am ready to Boyne stopped reading folded up the letter and thrust it into his pocket There rushed over him a
wave of disappointment and disgust Dear little Blanca indeed he muttered furiously Useful members of society That Mrs Sellars should calmly propose to separate the children was bad
enough but that of the lot she should choose to foist on him the only one he could feel no affection for and hardly any interest in that to the woman he was going to marry Blanca should alone seem
worthy of compassion among the four little girls who had been cast upon his mercy this was to Boyne hatefully significant of the side of Mrs Sellars s character to which from the moment of their reunion
he had been trying to close his eyes She chooses her because she knows she need never be jealous of her was his inmost thought
Well and supposing it were so how womanly how human after all Loving Boyne as she did was it not natural that she should prefer to have under her roof the two children least likely to come between
herself and him to interfere in any way with their happiness Yes but was that loving him at all If she had really loved him would she not have entered into his feeling about the little group and
recognised the cruelty of separating them He paused a moment over this and tried conscientiously to imagine what in a similar case his love for her would have inspired him to do Would it for instance
ever induce him to live with Aunt Julia as a dependent nephew in law A million times no But why propound such useless riddles No one could pretend that the cases were similar Rose Sellars would
simply be asking him to gratify a whim what he was asking of her was vital inevitable She knew that it lay with him and with no one else to save these children she knew that little by little his whole
heart had gone into the task Yet coolly deliberately with that infernal air she had of thinking away

whatever it was inconvenient to admit she had affected to sympathise with his purpose while in reality her proposal ignored it Send back the younger children to their parents to such parents as Zinnia
Lacrosse and Buondelmonte return Judith to her mother to a mother about to marry Gerald Ormerod who by Judith s own showing would have preferred herself Boyne recoiled from the
thought as from the sight of some physical cruelty he could not prevent He got up threw away his cigar and went out hatless indignant into the night
The air was warm the sky full of clouds tunnelled by shifting vistas of a remote blue sprinkled with stars Boyne groped his way down the obscure wood path from his hotel and walked across the fields
to the slopes which Judith and he had climbed on the day of his return from the Lido It was from that day he recalled it now that Rose Sellars s jealousy of Judith had dated he had seen it flash across
her fixed attentive face when the next morning Judith had blurted out an allusion to their ramble
Boyne he also remembered had given Mrs Sellars to understand that on that occasion he had gone off for a walk by himself to get the Lido out of his lungs very likely his prevarication had first
excited her suspicion For why should he dissemble the fact that he had been with Judith if Judith was only a child to him as he said Why indeed It seemed as though in concealing so significant a fact he
had simply unconsciously been on his guard against this long suspected jealousy as if he had always guessed that the most passionate and irrational of sentiments lurked under Mrs Sellars s calm and
reasonable exterior If it were so it certainly made her more interesting but also less easy to deal with For jealousy to excite sympathy must be felt by some one who also inspires it Shared it was a
part of love unshared it made love impossible And Boyne in his fatuous security could not imagine feeling jealous of Mrs Sellars Though of course I should hate it like anything I suppose But the
problem was one that he could only apprehend intellectually
He tramped on through the summer night his mind full of tormented thoughts and as he groped upward among the pines he remembered that other night not many weeks since when he had climbed
the same path and his feet had seemed winged and the air elixir because a girl s shoulder brushed his own and he listened to unpremeditated laughter
It was so late when he got back to the hotel that the porter unwillingly roused looked at him with a sulky astonishment
There was a lady here she left a parcel for you A lady Where s the parcel
Up in your room I had to help her to carry it up It was awkward getting it round the turn of the stairs She left a letter for you too
Awkward round the turn of the stairs What on earth could the object be and who the lady Boyne without farther questions sprang up to his room Rose had come back there could be no doubt of it
She had decided adroitly enough to follow up her letter by the persuasion of her presence At the thought he felt flurried unsettled as if she had come too soon before he had set his mind in order to
And what could she possibly have brought him that had to be man uvred up the hotel stairs
Whatever it was he could not try as he would figure her labouring up to his room with it even with the assistance of the porter Why she had never even been to his room the room with every chair and
table of which Judith and the other children were so carelessly familiar It was utterly unlike Rose and yet Rose of course it must be
He flung open his door and saw a large shrouded object in the middle of the floor an object of odd uncertain shape imperfectly wrapped in torn newspapers tied with string The wrappings yielded to a
pull and an ancient walnut cradle with primitive carven ornaments revealed itself to his petrified gaze
A cradle He threw himself into a chair and stared at it incredulously as if he knew it must be an hallucination At length he remembered the porter s having mentioned a letter and his glance strayed
to his chest of drawers There perched on the pincushion was an envelope addressed in a precise
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html familiar hand the hand of Terry Wheater always the scribe of the other children when their letters
were to be subjected to grown up criticism Boyne tore the envelope open and read
Darling Martin We are all of us sending you this lovely cradle for your wedding present because we suppose you are going to
be married very soon as we think Mrs Sellars has gone to Paris to order her trousseau And because you have been like a father to us we hope and pray you will soon be a real father to a lot of lovely little children of your own
and they will all sleep in this cradle and then you will think of Your loving Judith Terry Blanca
Under the last of the rudimentary signatures Chipstone had scrawled his mark and below it was a scribbled postscript from Judith Darling I open this while Terry s not looking to say he said we
oughternt to call the craidle lovely but it is lovely and we wanted you to know it was Judith In the midnight silence Boyne sat and laughed and laughed until a nervous spinster in the next room

XXV oyne had been wrong in imagining that Mrs Sellars might come back unannounced to assure
herself of the effect of her letter She did not do so and after two days he decided that he could no longer put off sending some kind of answer
Only what could he say
Being with the children all day and every day sharing their meals their games and scrambles had gradually detached his thoughts from Mrs Sellars reducing her once more to the lovely shadow she
had so long been with the difference that she was now a shadow irrevocably whereas before he had always believed she might become substantial Finally he girt himself to the task and at once his
irritation his impatience seemed to materialise her again as if she were fated to grow real only when she thwarted or opposed him He wondered if that were another of the peculiarities of being in love
People get too close to each other they can t see each other for the nearness I suppose he reflected not altogether satisfied with this explanation He wrote And as to what you propose about the
children do please believe that I don t mean to be unreasonable but unless I m a little mad your suggestion apparently amounts to this that I should shove them straight back into the hell I ve
temporarily got them out of For them that hell at least the worst of it is being separated from each other and you ask me to separate them when to keep them together is the one thing that they and I
have been fighting for I make no comment on your proposal to hand over the younger ones to Lady Wrench and Buondelmonte women like you are what they are at the price of not being able even to
picture such people as those two But I know what they are and never as long as I can help it will I be a party to giving back into such hands these children who have trusted me And when you say that
Judith thanks to whom the younger ones have developed a sense of solidarity and mutual trust in a world which is the very negation of such feelings that Judith should be asked to see her work
deliberately wrecked and all the feelings she has cultivated in the others trampled on He broke off flung down the pen and sat hopelessly staring at what he had written Oh hell that s no use he
The truth was that even in his most rebellious moments he could not trick himself into the idea that he had a grievance against Mrs Sellars In reality it was the other way round When he had gone
to Venice to negotiate with the Wheaters about the future of their mutinous family he had gone as an affianced man In pledging himself to his strange guardianship he had virtually pledged Mrs Sellars
also and without even making his promise depend on her consent He had simply assumed that because she loved him she would approve of whatever he did would accept any situation he chose to
put her in He had behaved in short like a romantic boy betrothed to a dreamer of his own age All this was true and it was true also that Mrs Sellars had never reproached him with it The sense of her
magnanimity deprived his argument of all its force and benumbed his angry pen He pushed away the letter pulled out another sheet and scrawled on it Awfully sorry but cannot undo what I have done
do try to understand me dearest Yes a telegram was better easier to write at any rate He tore up the letter put on his hat and
walked down to the post office with his message
For its answer he had only twenty four hours to wait and when Mrs Sellars s telegram came it merely said I do understand you letter follows Well that was not unsatisfactory as far as it went
but when two days more had elapsed it was not a letter but a small registered packet which the postman put into Boyne s hands Even in the act of signing the receipt at his very first glance he had
guessed what the packet contained He went up to his room a little dizzy with the abruptness of the event and angrily ripped off seal and string revealing the morocco box he had expected to find there
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html For a minute or two he sat looking at the box almost as unconscious of what he was feeling as a man in
the first minute or two after being stabbed or shot So that s that he said aloud But what that was going to be he had as yet no notion It was a wound of course but was it mortal He didn t know
Suddenly with a mumbled curse at his own plight he snapped the box open and saw a thin slip of paper twisted about the sapphire ring On the paper he read I shall always remember I shall never
resent and that is why I want you to give this to some woman who can make you as happy as you have made me He pitched the box and the paper aside and hid his face in his hands After all he must
have loved her he supposed or at least the vision of her which their long separation had created
He was roused by a knock and looking up with dazed eyes saw Judith Wheater standing doubtfully on the threshold
Oh Martin dear were you asleep or have you got one of those beastly headaches She came in and closed the door without waiting for his answer Have I disturbed you most awfully she
questioned passing her cool hand softly over his hair
Yes no He wondered whether her sharp eyes had already detected the open ring box and the paper signed with Rose s name But to try to conceal them would only attract her attention He put up
his hand and pressed hers Yes I believe I have got a beastly headache he said
Then I d better be off perhaps she interrupted reluctantly She was bending over him with the look she had when one of the children fell and scraped a knee and Boyne could not help smiling up
into her anxious eyes That depends on what you came for What s up Anything wrong at Rosengl h
Not particularly But you know dear we haven t seen you for two whole days You haven t In the struggle which had been going on in his mind since he had received Mrs
Sellars s letter he had completely forgotten the passage of time No more you have he exclaimed I didn t realise I d neglected you all so shamefully Fact is I ve been tied up to a boring piece of business
that I had to get off my chest Sit down and have a cigarette He fumbled for a box and shoved it across the table to Judith who had settled down comfortably into his only armchair Oh Martin how
lovely to be here all alone with you Well I don t believe you ll find me particularly good company he rejoined suddenly conscious of
the ears of the acrimonious spinster next door and wondering if he ought not to propose to Judith to finish her visit in the garden
Oh yes I shall if you ll let me talk to you she declared with her rich candour and Boyne laughed in spite of himself
I ve never been able to prevent your talking when you wanted to he remarked lighting a cigarette
and Judith thrust her thin shoulder blades into the chair back crossed her legs and sighed contentedly Few can
Well then what s your news A letter from mother this morning
The laugh died on Boyne s lips The expected menace here it was He knew Joyce never wrote unless she had news of overwhelming importance and usually of a disagreeable nature to impart
What does she say he asked apprehensively
Not much I can t quite make out She just says she s given up Gerald and that she realises for the first time what a rotten rubbishy life she s been leading and wants us all to forgive her for it
She does But then Judith shrugged away his anticipations with a faint smile Oh that s not particularly new Mother
always realises about the rottenness of her life when she s going to make a change A change What sort of a change
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Getting engaged to somebody else generally Oh come my dear Why shouldn t it mean this time just what I ve always hoped that your father
and mother see they can t get on without you all of you and that they re going to patch it up for good and all
Judith scanned him half humorously through the veil of her cigarette smoke Like in the nicer kind of movies
You young sceptic you Why not Your mother s too intelligent not to be fed up with jazz some day
That s what she says She says she s met somebody who s opened her eyes to how wrong it all is and that always means she s going to get engaged again Boyne was silent and Judith added
Anyhow she s leaving at once for Paris to start divorce proceedings because she says it s too wicked to live any longer with a man like father
The load dropped from Boyne s heart If Mrs Wheater was leaving for Paris without suggesting that the children should join her it was at least a respite how long a one he couldn t guess but at any rate
enough to provide an excuse for deferring action That was as far as his hopes dared venture But he met Judith s eyes and was surprised at their untroubled serenity Aren t you afraid he began and
she rejoined immediately With you here Why should we be Immediately the sense of his responsibility descended on him with a redoubled weight To have
taken the risks he had for these children was mad enough but to find that his doing so had deified him in their imagination made them regard him as a sort of human sanctuary turned his apprehensions to
But my child look here We ve been awfully lucky so far but we mustn t forget that any day this arrangement of ours may go to smash How can I prevent it
She gave him all her confidence in a radiant look You have till now haven t you And if there s another row couldn t we all nip over quietly to America with you She paused and then began again
with a shade of hesitation that was new in her I suppose you ll be married very soon now won t you Martin And when I got mother s letter this morning we wondered Terry and I wondered whether
if Grandma Mervin is afraid to take us in we couldn t all go and live with you in New York if we children paid a part of the rent You see father and mother couldn t possibly object to that and I
know you and Mrs Sellars are fond of Chip and the steps and we big ones really wouldn t be any trouble Scopy and I have saved up such a lot out of father s allowance that I daresay you could afford
to take a biggish house and we d all be awfully decent in the morning about not keeping the bath a minute longer than we had a right to
The abruptness of Judith s transitions from embittered shrewdness to nursery simplicity was always disconcerting When ways and means had to be considered the disenchanted maiden for whom life
seemed to have no surprises became once more the helpless little girl in the hands of nurses and governesses At such moments Boyne thought she was like a young Daphne half emerging into
reality half caught in the foliage of fairyland
My dear child She always responded to every change in his intonation and as he spoke he saw the shadow in her
eyes before it reached her lips Trying to keep a smile on them she interrupted Now I ve said something stupid again
You ve said something unexpected that s all Give me a little time She sprang up and moved toward him with one of her impulsive darts Martin When people ask
for time it s always for time to say no Yes has one more letter in it but it doesn t take half as long to say And now you ll hate me for asking you something that you ve got to take time to answer
Not a bit of it I want time because I ve got several answers And the first is how do you know your Grandma Mervin won t take you all in
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She shook her head Because I wrote to her a month ago and she s taking time before she answers
And besides really and truly I ve always known that if Grandma Mervin did take us in she d give us up again the minute father shouted loud enough You see Judith added with a sudden spring back to
her wistful maturity grandma gets a big allowance from father All right that brings me to my second answer How do you know your father won t order you back
at once to the Lido or wherever he is if your mother has definitely decided to leave him Because father s gone off to Constantinople on the yacht with Syb Mrs Lullmer I mean and a
whole crowd of people In spite of himself Boyne again drew a breath of relief If Wheater was off on the Fancy Girl with a
band of cronies and his wife rushing to Paris to start divorce proceedings there might indeed be no need for an immediate decision Never had procrastination seemed so sweet
Well my dear in that case it would appear that they re both going to let you alone for a while at any rate So why jump unnecessary ditches
Judith responded with a joyful laugh Who wants to darling I don t As long as you re with us I always feel safe Again a little shiver of apprehension ran over Boyne but he dissembled it by joining
in her laugh The more precarious was the tie between himself and the little Wheaters the more precious seemed the days he could still hope to spend with them he would not cloud another with vain
fears Right you are Suppose we go and do something desperate to celebrate the occasion What about a good tramp for you and me and then supper with the little Wheaters
She stood looking at him with her happiest eyes Hurrah Martin I haven t seen you so jolly for days Terry was afraid you were moping because Mrs Sellars had gone he thought that was why you
hadn t been to see us and we decided that I d better come up and find out Trust you to find out he grinned and added sardonically I m bearing up as you see But come
along Don t let s waste any more sunshine She moved obediently toward the door but stopped short halfway with an exclamation of surprise
Boyne who was rummaging in a corner for his stick turned about to see her standing before the ancient cradle
Oh Martin you you keep your boots in it A reproachful flush rose to her face and was momentarily reflected in his own Hang it why was he always such an untidy fellow And why was a
cradle so uncommonly handy to hold boots Jove how stupid Must have been that confounded chambermaid But he broke off in confusion as he caught Judith s incredulous eye Well hang it
you know I ve nothing else to put in it just at present he cried defiantly
Her face softened and she met his banter with the wistful tentative gaze that he called her Monreale look But very soon you will have won t you A baby of your own I mean she explained I suppose
you and Mrs Sellars are going to be married as soon as she gets back with her trousseau aren t you
Blanca and I were wondering if perhaps she d ask us to be bridesmaids Boyne was flinging the boots out of the cradle with an angry hand and made no answer to this
suggestion Judith stood and watched him for a few moments then she went to his side and slipped her arm through his Why Martin I believe you re very unhappy she exclaimed
Unhappy Unhappy He swung around on her exasperated Well yes I suppose I am unhappy
It s a way people have you know But for the Lord s sake can t you ever let things be Can t you ever keep from treading on people s toes I oh damn it Judy look here for God s sake don t cry I didn t
mean to say anything to hurt you I swear I didn t Only sometimes Oh I know I know you mean I have no tact she wailed
Damn tact I m thankful you haven t There s nothing I hate as much as tact But here don t look so scared child There s no harm done only don t try meddling with grown up things It ll just wreck
everything if you do
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html But how can I not meddle when I love you so and when I see that things are going wrong for you
Martin she flung out breathlessly you don t mean to say you re not going to be married after all Temptation suddenly twitched through him It was as if saying Yes to her question might be the
magic formula of freedom After all there lay the ring he was free technically had only to utter the words to make them true But he thrust his hands into his pockets and stood sullenly planted before
the corner of the table on which he had tossed the open ring box Not in this way he thought Aloud he said I mean that I don t yet know when I m going to be married That s all
Positively all He nodded
Ah she sighed relieved It was evident that she identified herself whole heartedly with his sentimental troubles of whatever nature and by whomsoever they were caused
She was still looking up at him her face full of compunction and perplexity and suddenly he put his arm about her and bent his head to her lips They looked round and glowing as they did in laughter or
emotion they drew his irresistibly But he turned his head aside and his kiss fell harmlessly on her cheek near the tear hung lashes That s my old Judy Come cheerio On with your hat and we ll go
up the mountain He saw that she was still trembling and took her by the arm in the old brotherly way Come he repeated let s go out
In the doorway she paused and flung a last tragic glance at the cradle You poor old Martin you I suppose it s because you re so unhappy that you put your boots in it she sighed

XXVI o Boyne the calm of the next day brought no reassurance Too many uncertainties hung close
After a night of pondering he had sent back the ring to Mrs Sellars with a brief line saying that she was of course free if she chose to be but that he could not so regard himself till they had had a talk
and she had convinced him that she would be happier if their engagement ended
He knew that he was merely using an old formula the accepted one in such cases and he longed to get away from it to be spontaneous honest himself But as he wrote it became clear to him that he
was terribly sorry for Rose Sellars terribly sorry for having disappointed her and that such phrases the kind he had been brought up on were the devices of decent people who hated to give pain and
were even capable of self sacrifice to avoid it After all they were a lot better than we are he thought
and the thought softened the close of his letter and impelled him to add Do be patient with me dear
As soon as I can get away I ll come This done the whole problem vanished to the background of his mind He was hardly aware that he
was no longer thinking of it His life of practical activities and swift decisions had given him the habit of easily dismissing matters once dealt with He flattered himself that he could thus dispose of
sentimental cares as easily as of professional problems and to a certain extent it was true Behind the close knit foreground of his daily life there had hung for years the mirage of Rose Sellars but that
mirage was now the phantom of a phantom and he averted his eyes lest he should find that it had faded into nothing
After Mrs Wheater s letter to Judith there came no more alarms to the Pension Rosengl h and the days slipped by in a security which seemed satisfying to Judith and even to Miss Scope But summer
was waning in the high valleys of the Dolomites tourists were scattering the big hotels preparing to close By and by a cold sparkle began to fill the air in the early mornings and at night the temperature
fell to freezing On the lower slopes the larches were turning to pale gold and the bare cliffs burned with an intenser fire against a sky as hard as metal The very magic of the hastening days warned
Boyne that they could not last and that the change in the landscape symbolized another as imminent in the fortunes of his party
Mrs Sellars had written again sweetly and reasonably saying that she intended to remain for the present with Aunt Julia who was settled in Paris for two or three months If Boyne really wished for
another talk she added she hoped he would be able to come before long but in any case he could count on her affectionate understanding She closed her letter with a friendly message to the children
Boyne had been afraid that Judith would revert again to the subject of his private anxieties but she contrived by a visible effort which made him feel for the first time that she was really growing up to
keep off the forbidden topic His own return to a more equable mood no doubt helped her and so did the presence of the younger children and their preceptors Boyne half unconsciously avoided being
alone with Judith and the shortening days and freshening temperature curtailed their expeditions and gave more time for games and romps around the cheerful stove in the children s dining room
It was there that one rainy afternoon he found himself sitting with the younger children Judith had gone with Miss Scope and Nanny to Toblach to fit out the family with autumn underclothes Terry
was upstairs working with his tutor Chip asleep in Susan s care and Blanca in the corner nearest the stove was brooding over a torn copy of The Tatler with the passionate frown she always bent on the
study of fashion plates Skirts are going to be fuller she said I ve been telling Judy so for a month
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Zinnie lifted her head from the rapt contemplation of an electric engine which Bun was putting
together under Boyne s directions The lady that was here today had her skirt longer a lot longer than Judy s she remarked
Beechy whose attention was also riveted on the motions of Bun s agile fingers interrupted indignantly She wasn t pretty like our Judy
The lady What lady Boyne interposed vaguely apprehensive Have you got a new lodger here Blanca re entered the conversation with a sniff You wouldn t have taken her for one if you d seen
her She s not the Rosengl h kind She would certainly have been at the Palace if it hadn t been closed Not exactly smart you know smartness has been so overdone hasn t it She was what s that
funny old word that Scopy loves distinguished At least I think that s what distinguished means
the way that lady looked Her clothes awfully plain but not the least sports Rather governessy really like Scopy young if Chanel could have dressed her Blanca paused reduced to silence by
the hopelessness of the attempt to fit her words to her meaning
Boyne looked up from the engine Perhaps when you ve finished with her clothes you ll tell me what she came for
To see you you you cried Zinnie executing a double handspring she had lately learned from Bun to the despair of Beechy who was so fat that she invariably collapsed midway of the same
attempt I could have told you that Zinnie added for I spoke to her You did What impertinence cried Blanca bounding from her seat Bun flat on his stomach his
legs in the air his curls mixed with the engine chanted over his shoulder Girls are always butting in butting in
Nasty rotters girls are sympathised Beechy always ready to champion her brother and not as yet very clear as to her own sex
Zinnie s reprisals were checked by the discovery that the landlady s gold fish aquarium which usually stood in the larger and colder public dining room had been brought in and placed on a stand
before the window She tiptoed off to inspect this forbidden Paradise while Boyne got to his feet and picked up the electric wire Where s the battery Are your rails straight Now then Bun are you
ready He turned to Zinnie To see me did you say What on earth for Did she tell you Tell Zinnie So likely ejaculated Blanca with a shrug She turned to Boyne drawing her lids
together with her pretty cat like smile F licitations cher ami Elle tait plut t bien la dame vous savez
Oh shucks zif we didn t all of us talk French commented Zinnie still watchfully circling about the aquarium
The door opened and a maid came in with a card which she handed hesitatingly to Boyne The name on it was Princess Buondelmonte and underneath was written begs Mr Boyne to see her on
important business Boyne crammed the card into his pocket without speaking conscious that the eyes of all the children were upon him
It s the lady it s the lady I know it is Zinnie piped I heard her say she was coming back to see Martin She s come all the way from Rome to see him
Blanca at his side had slid an insinuating hand in his From Rome Oh Martin who is it Mayn t I come with you at any rate as far as the door I do want to see if her dress is made of kasha or
crepella just to be able to tell Judy Boyne checked her firmly You ve got to stay here and mind the infants It s nothing important I ll
be back in a few minutes He thanked his stars that the lady had sent in her card instead of confiding her name to the maid He could not imagine what his noble visitor wanted of him but the very sight of
the name had let loose all his fears As he left the room he turned and sent a last glance toward the group sprawling around the engine which had after all refused to start orange curls mixed with
brown and dusky sunburnt legs kicking high voices mixed in breathless controversy How healthy
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html and jolly they all looked And how good they smelt with that mixed smell of woollen garments and
soap and the fruity fragrance of young bodies tumbled about together As Boyne looked back at them he thought how funny and dear they were and how different the world might have been if Rose Sellars
had freed herself when he and she were still young
A lady with a slim straight back was standing in the sitting room attentively examining the stuffed eagle above the stove She turned at Boyne s entrance and revealed a small oval face somewhat pale
with excessively earnest gray eyes and a well modelled nose and brow It puzzled him to discover why an assemblage of such agreeable features did not produce an effect of beauty but a second glance
suggested that it was because their owner had never thought about being beautiful That she had graver preoccupations was immediately evident from the tone of her slow and carefully modulated
speech Mr Boyne she asked as though she feared he might deny his identity and was immediately prepared if he did to disprove the denial and on his saying that he was she continued with a touch
of nervousness I have come all the way from Rome to see my children Your children Boyne echoed in astonishment and she corrected herself with a slight blush I
should say the Prince s Or my step children But I hate the word for I feel about them already as if they were my own
Boyne pushed an armchair forward and she sat down crossing her feet neatly and satisfying herself that the skirt which Zinnie described as long was so adjusted as not to reveal too much of the pretty
legs above her slender ankles They are here Astorre and Beatrice Boyne heard her with dismay but kept up a brave exterior Here Oh yes certainly Mr and Mrs
Wheater sent all the children here a few weeks ago for the climate Princess Buondelmonte met this with a smile of faint incredulity In your charge I understand
Yes But of course you must know that Mr and Mrs Wheater have really no business whatever to send my husband s children here or anywhere else She paused a moment and added And I have come
to take them home Oh Princess Boyne exclaimed
She raised her handsome eyebrows slightly and said You seem surprised Well yes At any rate I m awfully sorry
Sorry Don t you think that children ought to be in their own home with their own parents Well that depends
Depends How can it ever She crimsoned suddenly and then grew even paler than before I don t suppose you intend to insinuate She broke off and he saw that her eyes had filled with tears
For of course that I won t tolerate for a single instant she added a little breathlessly as though throwing herself on his mercy in a conflict she felt to be unequal if it should turn on Prince
Buondelmonte s merits as a father
Boyne felt so sorry for her that he answered I wasn t thinking of insinuating anything I only meant that this little group of children have always been together and it has made them so fond of each other
that they really regard themselves as one family It seems a pity it seems cruel Cruel she interrupted The real cruelty has been to deprive the poor little things for so long of a
father s influence to take advantage of of Prince Buondelmonte s misfortunes his undeserved misfortunes to keep his children without a real home without family associations without without
any guiding principle She leaned forward her grave almost terrified eyes on Boyne What guidance have they had What moral training What religious education Have you or your friends
ever thought that It s a big responsibility you ve assumed Have you never thought you might some day be asked to account for the use you ve made of it
Boyne heard her with a growing wonder She spoke slowly but fluently not as if repeating a lesson learned by rote but as though she were sustaining a thesis with the ease of a practised orator There

she was trembling with nervousness yet that her nerves would never control her and his heart sank

dignity I ought perhaps to explain that I took my degree cum laude in Eugenics and Infant Psychology at Lohengrin College Texas You may have heard that my grandfather Dr Judson Tring
was the founder of the college and also its first President She stopped again glanced half proudly half shyly at Boyne as though to see how much this glimpse of her genealogy had impressed him and
then pursued Can you give me for instance any sort of assurance that Astorre and Beatrice have ever been properly psychoanalyzed and that their studies and games have been selected with a view to
their particular moral alimentary dental and glandular heredity Games for instance should be quite as carefully supervised as studies but I know how little importance Europe still attaches to these
supremely vital questions No adequate answer occurred to Boyne and she rose from her seat with an impatient gesture I don t know that there is any use in continuing a discussion which would not in
any case affect my final decision or Prince Buondelmonte s Oh don t say that Boyne exclaimed
Don t Not if it means you won t listen to any plea won t first consider what it s going to be to these
children to be suddenly uprooted She interrupted It was not Prince Buondelmonte who first uprooted them It was through
circumstances of which he was himself the victim I may say Mr Boyne the chivalrous victim that he found himself obliged or thought himself obliged to trust Astorre and Beatrice for a while to Mrs
Wheater He did it simply in order that no breath of calumny should touch her The Princess paused and added with a genuine tremor in her voice Though Mrs Wheater was not his children s mother
my husband always remembers that for a time she bore his name If the Princess s aim had been to reduce her interlocutor to silence she had at last succeeded Boyne
sat speechless wondering how much the granddaughter of Dr Judson Tring believed of what she was saying and to what extent her astounding version of the case was the result of patient schooling on her
husband s part He concluded that she was incapable of deliberate deception and fully convinced of the truth of her assertions and he knew this would make it all the harder to reason with her For a few
moments the two faced each other without speaking then Boyne said But surely the fact that Prince Buondelmonte did leave his children with Mrs Wheater ought to be considered If he was willing to
have her keep them he must have thought she knew how to take care of them The Princess again interrupted him My husband left his children with Mrs Wheater for the
reasons I ve told you but also because owing to unfortunate circumstances he had at the time no home to give them and they had no mother to care for them Now all that is changed Since our
marriage we have fortunately been able to buy back the Buondelmonte palace in Rome and I am as anxious as he is that his children should come and live with us there
Boyne stood up impatiently The talk was assuming more and more the tone of a legal debate
conducted on such lines there seemed no reason for its ever ending If one accepted the Princess s premises and Boyne had no way of disproving them it was difficult to question her conclusions All
he could do was to plead his lack of authority He reminded his visitor that Mrs Wheater to whom for whatever reason their father had confided Bun and Beechy had in her turn passed them over to their
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
present guardians who were therefore answerable to her and her only The Princess s lips parted nervously on the first syllable of a new protest but Boyne interrupted Princess It s really so simple
I mean the legal part If your husband has a right to his children no one can prevent his getting them
The real issue seems to me quite different It concerns only the children themselves They re so desperately anxious not to be separated they re so happy together Of course none of that is my doing
It s their eldest step sister or whatever you like to call her Mrs Wheater s eldest daughter Judith who has kept the six of them together through all the ups and downs of their parents matrimonial
troubles Before you decide The Princess lifted an imperative hand Mr Boyne I m sorry I can see that you re very fond of the
children But fondness is not everything it may even be a source of moral danger I m afraid we shouldn t altogether agree as to the choice of the persons Mrs Wheater has left in charge of them not
even as to her own daughter The soul of a child Yes Boyne acquiesced that s the very thing I m pleading for If you could see them together
Oh but I intend to she responded briskly
Her promptness took him aback Now you mean She gave a smiling nod Certainly You don t suppose I came from Rome for any other reason But
you needn t be afraid of my kidnapping them Her eyes became severe again I hope it won t have to come to that but of course I intend to see my husband s children
Oh all right Boyne agreed He was beginning to divine under her hard mechanical manner something young and untried something one might still reach and appeal to and he reflected that the
sight of the children would perhaps prove to be the simplest way of reaching it The children are playing in the other room he said Shall I go and get Bun and Beechy or do you prefer to see them
first with the others The Princess said yes she thought she would like to see them all together at their games Games
have such a profound psychological significance she explained with a smile
Well I m glad you re going to take them by surprise It s always the best way with children You ll see what jolly little beggars they are how they all understand each other how well they get on
together I m counting on the sight to plead our cause He led her down the passage and threw open the door of the children s dining room
On the threshold they were met by a burst of angry voices Everything in the room was noise and confusion and the opening of the door remained unheeded In all his experience of the little Wheaters
Boyne had never before seen them engaged in so fierce a conflict it seemed incredible that the participants should be only four Some were screaming some vituperating some doing both and
butting at each other head down at the same time The floor was strewn with the wreckage of battle but the agitated movements of the combatants made the origin of the dispute hard to discover God
Boyne ejaculated stepping back
Zinnie s voice rose furiously above the others It wasn t me t upset the quarium I swear it wasn t Blanca and those two wops know it just as well as I do
Bun squealed back It was you that tried to bathe Chip s rabbit in it you dirty little lying sneak you
No I didn t neither but Nanny don t never give him enough to drink n so I just ran up and brought him down while Chip was asleep n if Beechy hadn t gone and butted in
You rotten little liar you you know you were trying to find out if rabbits can swim No I wasn t either And it was Beechy pushed me gainst the quarium and you know it was
Cos the rabbit was drownding and Judy d have killed you if you d of let it Beechy wailed
She ll kill you anyhow if you call us wops again roared Bun

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Blanca reluctantly torn from her study of The Tatler had risen from the stove corner and was
distributing slaps and shakes with a practised hand As she turned to the door and saw Boyne and his visitor on the threshold her arms dropped to her sides and she swept the shrieking children into a
corner behind her Oh Martin I m so sorry Did you ever see such a pack of savages They were playing some silly game and I didn t realise She addressed herself to Boyne but as usual it was
the newcomer who fixed her attention What will your friend think she murmured with a deprecating glance
Princess Buondelmonte pale and erect stood in the doorway and returned her gaze I shall think just what I expected to she said coldly She turned to Boyne and continued in a trembling voice It is
just as I was saying nothing in a child s education should be left to chance Games have to be directed even more carefully than studies Telling a child that an older person will kill it seems to me so
unspeakably wicked This perpetuating of the old militarist instinct Kill is one of the words we have entirely eliminated at Lohengrin Still nervously she addressed herself again to Blanca I do
hope she said that the particular little savage who made that threat doesn t happen to be mine to be Prince Buondelmonte s I mean
Blanca was looking at her with a captivated stare You don t mean to say you re his new wife Are you the Princess Buondelmonte really
Yes I m the Princess Buondelmonte the visitor assented with a smile of girlish gratification which made her appear almost as young as Blanca It was manifest that however heavily the higher
responsibilities weighed on her she still enjoyed the sound of her new title
But Bun brushing aside the little girls had flung himself impetuously upon her Are you really and truly my father s new wife Then you must tell him he s got to send me a gun at once to shoot
everybody who calls me and Beechy a wop The visitor stooped down laying a timid yet resolute hand on his dark head What I shall do my
dear is to carry you off at once you and little Beatrice to your own home to your own dear father who s pining for you to a place where nobody ever talks about shooting and killing
Bun s face fell perceptibly Won t my father give me a gun don t you suppose Then I don t believe Beechy n me d care such a lot about going
The Princess s lips narrowed with the same air of resolution which had informed her hand Oh but I m afraid you ve got to Astorre This is not your real home you know and I m going to take you both
away to the loveliest house and your father ll give you lots of other things you ll like ever so much better
Not than a gun I won t said Bun immovably

XXVII ake away my children Take them away from me Judith Wheater had pushed open the door
and stood there small and pale in her dripping mackintosh and bedraggled hat She gave a little laugh and her gray eyes measured the stranger with a deliberate and freezing scrutiny I don t in the
least know who you are she said but I know you don t know what you re talking about She glanced away to the ravaged scene and the frightened excited faces of the children Heavens What an
unholy mess What on earth has been happening Oh the poor drenched rabbit Here wrap it up in my scarf Nanny take the children upstairs and send Susan at once to tidy up Yes Blanca you must
go too If you can t keep the little ones in order you ve got to be treated like one of them She turned to the bewildered visitor I m Miss Wheater If you want to see me will you please come into the sittingroom Her eye fell on Boyne who had drawn back into the dusk of the passage as if disclaiming any
part in the impending drama Martin she challenged him was it you who brought this lady here It s the Princess Buondelmonte Judith
Judith again scanned her with unrelenting eyes I m afraid that won t make any difference she said The Princess stood drooping her high crest a little as if unused to receiving instructions from one
so much smaller and younger than herself Boyne remembered how Judith had awed and baffled Mrs
Sellars on their first meeting and his heart swelled with irrational hopes Judith he cautioned her below his breath
This way You ll come too please Martin She led them down the passage and into the sittingroom After she had closed the door she pushed forward a chair for the Princess Buondelmonte and said with emphasis Perhaps you don t know that Mr Boyne has been appointed the guardian of the
children The Princess did not seat herself She leaned on the back of the chair and smiled down at the
champion of the little Wheaters They seem to have a great many guardians I hear you re one of them too
Me Judith s eyes widened in astonishment I m only their eldest sister All I do is just to try to look after them
Something in her accent seemed to touch the Princess who seated herself in the chair on which she had been leaning made sure that her skirts did not expose more than a decent extent of ankle and
began to speak in a friendlier tone I m sure you re perfectly devoted to them that all you want is what s best for them
Judith paused a moment That depends on what you mean by best All I want is for us all to stay together
The Princess made a sign of comprehension Yes But supposing it was not what s best for the children
Oh but it is said Judith decisively The other hesitated and she pressed on Because nobody can possibly love them as much as Martin and Miss Scope and me
I see But you seem to have forgotten that they have parents No It s the parents who ve forgotten Judith flashed back
Not all of them Since I m here the Princess smiled
What Because you ve just married Prince Buondelmonte and probably think he ought to have remembered to look after Bun and Beechy Well I think so too Only he didn t you see not when they
were little and had to be wiped and changed and fed and walked up and down when they were cutting
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
their teeth And now that they re big enough to cut up their own food and be good company I suppose you and he think it would be fun to come and carry them off the way you d pick out a pair of Pekes at a
dog show only you forget that in the meantime they ve grown to love us and not you and that they re devoted to all the other children and that it would half kill them to be separated from each
other Oh devoted the Princess protested with her dry smile
Of course they are Why do you ask Because they were having a scrap when you came in Did that tussle about a gold fish frighten you Have you never seen children bite and scratch before Judith
gave a contemptuous shrug I pity you she said the first time you try to give Bun castor oil Was it victory or defeat Boyne and Judith sat late in the little sitting room asking themselves that
after the Princess Buondelmonte had gone It had been Boyne s idea and almost his only contribution to the fiery dialogue between the two that the Princess should be invited to return in the evening and
share the children s supper The proposal seconded by Judith after a swift glance at Boyne seemed to surprise their visitor and to disarm her growing hostility The encounter with Judith had not tended
to soften her feelings and for a moment it looked as if things were taking a dangerous turn but Boyne had intervened with the suggestion that the Princess having seen the children at their worst should be
given a chance to meet them in pleasanter circumstances He added that he would be glad of another talk with her and as she did not leave till the next day and was staying at an hotel near his own he
asked if he might walk back there with her and fetch her down again for supper She accepted both suggestions and after a mollified farewell to Judith started up the hill with Boyne He saw that she
was still inwardly agitated and clutching desperately at what remained of her resolution and he put in a pacifying word in excuse of Judith s irritability and assured the Princess that the Wheaters would
make no difficulty in recognising the Prince s legal right to his children The real question he went on was surely quite different was one of delicacy of good taste if you chose to call it so Mrs Wheater
had taken in Beechy and Bun when their father was not able to she had given them the same advantages as her own children the Princess at this sounded an ironic murmur and had shown
them the same affection though all she had done Boyne hastened to add was as nothing to the patient unflagging devotion of their step sister who technically wasn t even a step sister On that
theme Boyne did not have to choose his words They poured out with a vehemence surprising even to himself The Princess he supposed whatever her educational theories were would agree that the
first thing young children needed was to be loved enough above all children exposed as they were in the Wheater world where every new divorce and remarriage thrust them again into unfamiliar
surroundings Through all these changes Boyne pointed out Judith had clung to her little flock loving them and teaching them to love each other she had even inspired governesses and nurses with her
own passionate fidelity so that in a welter of change the group had remained together protected and happy If only Boyne pleaded they could be left as they were for a few years longer perhaps if they
could it would be found when they finally rejoined their respective families that under Judith s care they had been better prepared for life than if their parents had insisted on separating them
The Princess listened attentively to his arguments but said little in reply Boyne suspected that she had been taught not to commit herself unless she was on familiar ground and apparently she was
unfamiliar with the kind of plea he made The sentiments he appealed to seemed to have a sort of romantic interest for her as feudal ruins might have for an intelligent traveller but he saw that there
were no words for them in her vocabulary
When they went back to the Pension Rosengl h for supper the children headed by Terry and Blanca presented a picture of such roseate harmony that the Princess was evidently struck To
complete the impression Chip who was always brought down at this hour to say goodnight walked in led by Nanny placed a confiding palm in the strange lady s said Howoodoo and wound his fingers
in her hair which he pronounced to be ike Oody s for Chip was beginning to generalise and to co
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html ordinate though his educators could not have put a name to the process any more than the Princess
could to the instinctive motions of the heart
Supper on the whole was a success The children were unusually well behaved even Zinnie subdued herself to the prevailing tone Bun and Beechy seated one on each side of their new stepmother and visibly awed by her proximity demeaned themselves with a restraint which the Princess
made several timid attempts to break down It was evident that what she had said about the prohibition of fire arms still rankled in Bun and both children were prim and non committal as they
always were to a degree unknown to the others once their distrust was aroused The Princess to conceal her embarrassment discoursed volubly about the historic interest of the ancestral palace
which her husband had succeeded in repurchasing and promised Bun that one of its spacious apartments should be fitted up as a modern playroom in which he would learn to replace his artless
antics by the newest feats in scientific gymnastics Bun s eyes glittered but after a reflective silence he shook his head We couldn t he said not f we wanted to the most awful way cos we ve all sworen a
noath on Scopy s book that we wouldn t This solemn self reminder caused Beechy s eyes to fill and Zinnie to cry out We d be damned
black hearted villains if we did The Princess looked distressed What do you mean by swearing an oath Astorre she asked
pronouncing the words as if they were explosives and must be handled with caution
I mean a nawful oath Bun explained with an effort at greater accuracy
But I can t bear to hear children talk about swearing or about villains either his step mother continued turning with a reproachful smile to Zinnie who promptly rejoined Then you d better not
ever have any of your own which caused the Princess to blush and lower her grave eyes
To hide her constraint she addressed a question to the company in general What is this book that you children speak of as Miss Scope s The choice of books is so imp
None of the younger children could pronounce the name of the book and they therefore preserved a respectful silence but Terry interrupted with a laugh Oh it s the book that Scopy cures us all out of
It s called the Cyclop dia of Nursery Remedies The Princess received this with a dubious frown I don t remember a book of that name being used
in our courses at Lohengrin is it a recent publication Miss Scope sat rigid and majestic at the opposite table end Thus directly challenged she replied
reassuringly Dear me no it s been thoroughly tested My mother and all my aunts used it in their families I believe even my grandmother
Even your grandmother But then the book must be completely obsolete and probably very dangerous
Miss Scope smiled undauntedly Oh I think not My mother always found it most reliable We were fourteen in the family ten miles from the railway in Lancashire and she brought us through all our
illnesses on it In a family of that size one couldn t always be sending for the doctor This gave her interlocutor s dismay a new turn Fourteen in your family You don t mean to say
your mother had fourteen children Miss Scope replied with undisguised pride that that was what she did mean and the Princess laid
down her fork with the air of one about to spring up and do battle against such deplorable abuses It s incredible she began then broke off to add in a lower tone But I suppose that at that time her
glance at Miss Scope s white head seemed to say that the whole business was an old unhappy far off thing and she resumed more hopefully In the United States such matters will soon be regulated by
legislation She met Miss Scope s horrified stare and glanced nervously about the table as if realising that the
subject even at Lohengrin might hardly be considered suitable for juvenile ears To relieve her embarrassment she leaned across Bun and addressed herself once more to Zinnie
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html You must be Lady Wrench s little girl aren t you my dear Only think I saw your mother the other
day in Venice she said in an affable attempt to change the conversation
Zinnie s face sparkled with curiosity Oh did you see her truly What did she have on do you remember
Have on The Princess hesitated with a puzzled look and Judith intervened Zinnie has a passion for pretty clothes
I think yours are awfully pretty Zinnie insidiously put in addressing the Princess and added
Are you sure my mother didn t give you any presents to give us Zinnie came reprovingly from Miss Scope
The Princess shook her head No she didn t give me any presents Perhaps she thinks you ought to come and get them But she gave me a message for you when she heard that I was coming here she
told me to tell you how dreadfully she wanted to see her little girl again Zinnie grew scarlet with excitement and gratification such notice lifted her at once above the other
children But an afterthought soon damped her pride If she really feels like that I d of thought she d of sent me a present she objected doubtfully
Presents aren t everything And it s not very nice to associate the people you love with the thought of what they may be going to give you Besides continued the Princess illogically if your mother is so
generous think how many presents you d get if you were always with her This seemed to plunge Zinnie into fresh perplexity Always with her How could I be She doesn t
want to dopt the lot of us does she Cos you see we ve all sweared You mustn t say swear said the Princess
Swore Zinnie corrected herself
I mean not use such words the Princess explained
But we did said Zinnie on Scopy s book so she d have to dopt us all with Judy Do you s pose she would
I don t know about that perhaps it might be difficult But why shouldn t she want to have her own little daughter with her The Princess again leaned over and laid a persuasive hand on Zinnie s
Don t you want me to take you back to Venice to your own real mother when I go to morrow There was a pause of suspense Boyne signed to Judith to keep silent and the children taking the
cue remained with spoons above their pudding and eyes agape while this perfidious proposal was submitted Zinnie from crimson had grown almost pale the orange spirals of her bushy head seemed
to droop with her drooping lips Her head sank on her neck and she twisted about in its crease of plumpness the necklace her mother had given her What kind of presents d you s pose they d be she
questioned back with caution
Oh I don t know dear But you oughtn t to think about that You ought to think only of your mother and her wanting so much to have you You must give me an answer to take back to her Shan t
I tell her you want to go to her Zinnie Zinnie hung her head still lower If it had been possible for a Wheater child to be shy she would
have appeared so but in reality she was only struggling with a problem beyond her powers At last she raised her head and looked firmly at the Princess I should like to consult my lawyer first she said
Boyne burst out laughing and the Princess nervously joined him perhaps to cover the appearance of defeat
Having so obviously failed to inspire the children with confidence she once more addressed herself to Miss Scope I should be so much interested in talking over your educational system with you I
suppose you ve entirely eliminated enforced obedience as we have at Lohengrin Enforced Miss Scope gave an incredulous gasp and her charges evidently struck by the
question again remained with suspended spoons and eyes eagerly fixed on the Princess Miss Scope
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html gave a curt laugh I ve never known children to obey unless they were forced to If you know a way to
make them I shall be glad to learn it she said drily
This seemed to cause the Princess more disappointment than surprise Ah that s just what we won t do make them We leave them as free as air and simply suggest to them to co operate At
Lohengrin co operation has superseded every other method We teach even our little two year olds voluntary co operation We think the idea of obedience is debasing She turned with a smile to her
step son When Astorre and Beatrice come to live with me the first thing I shall do is to make them both co operate
Bun received this unsmilingly and Beechy burst into passionate weeping and flung her arms jealously about her brother No no you bad wicked woman you mustn t You shan t operate on Bun
only on me if you must she added in a final wail her desperate eyes entreating her step mother
But my dear I don t understand the Princess murmured and Judith hurriedly explained that Blanca had been operated upon for appendicitis the previous year and that the use of the word in
connection with her illness had had an intimidating effect on the younger children and especially on Beechy
But this is all wrong dreadfully wrong the Princess said with a baffled sigh No one found an answer and supper being over Judith proposed that they should return to the sitting room The
children followed marshalled by Miss Scope and the Princess again tried to engage them in talk but she could not break down the barrier of mistrust which had been set up Finally she suggested that
they should all play a game together a quiet writing game she thought would be interesting A table was cleared and paper and pencils found with some difficulty and distributed among the children the
youngest of whom were lifted up onto sofa cushions to make their seats high enough for collaboration
The Princess explained that the game they were going to play was called Ambition and that it had been introduced into the Vocational Department of Juvenile Psychology at Lohengrin in order to
direct children s minds as early as possible to the choice of a career First of all she continued each was to write down what he or she would most like to be or to do then they were to fold the papers and
Mr Boyne was to shake them up in his hat and read them out in turn and as he read the children were to try to guess who had made each choice
The game did not start with as much lan as its organiser had perhaps hoped The children were still oppressed by her presence and all of them but Terry hated writing and were unused to abstract
speculations on the future moreover they probably felt that if they were to state with sincerity what they wanted to be their aspirations would be received with the friendly ridicule which grown ups
manifest when children express their real views
All this made for delay and hesitation and it was only Terry s persuasion and the fear of disobeying the tall authoritative lady who had suddenly invaded their lives which finally set their pencils going
Boyne received the papers shook them up conscientiously and began to read them out
Al If Boy oh a lift boy yes Zinnie s burning blush revealed her as the author of this ambition and Boyne read on An Ambassadoress Blanca of course and the added vowel certainly gave the
word a new stateliness A great Poet or the best Writer of Detective Stories in Terry s concise hand showed him torn between a first plunge into Conan Doyle and rapturous communion with The
Oxford Book of English Verse Boyne read on Never brush meye tethe laboriously printed out by Beechy A Crow Bat an
aspiration obviously to be ascribed to Bun A noble character bless Scopy As if she wasn t one already and lastly in Judith s rambling script An exploarer At the reading of that something
darted through Boyne like a whirr of wings
The ambitions expressed did not long serve to disguise the choosers and there was a prompt chorus of attributions as Boyne read out one slip after the other The Princess had apparently hoped that
something more striking would result She said the game usually promoted discussion and she hoped the next stage in it would lead to freer self expression The children she explained were now to say in
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html turn why that is on what grounds they wanted to be this or that But an awestruck silence met her
invitation to debate and Beechy again began to show signs of emotion The Princess seemed much distressed but was assured by Miss Scope that this breach of manners was due only to overexcitement and the strain of sitting up later than usual she hoped the Princess would excuse her but
really the children had better go to bed At this suggestion all the faces round the table lit up except Zinnie s which was clouded by a pout She slipped down from her cushions with the others but when
her turn came to file by the Princess for goodnight she held up the march past to ask N arn t there going to be any prizes after that game
She was swept off in Miss Scope s clutch and the Princess after a timid attempt at endearment imperfectly responded to when Bun and Beechy took leave sat down for a talk with Boyne and Judith
Much as she had evidently seen to disapprove of in the bringing up of the little Wheaters she was in a less aggressive mood than in the afternoon something she had been unprepared for and had only half
understood in the relation of the children to each other and to their elders seemed imperceptibly to have shaken her convictions Though she continued to repeat the same phrases it was with less
emphasis and she listened more patiently to Boyne s arguments and to Judith s entreaties
Judith was presently called away to say goodnight to the children and as soon as the Princess and Boyne were alone the former began abruptly But you must listen to me Mr Boyne you must
understand me It s not only that I cannot conscientiously approve of the way in which Beatrice and Astorre are being brought up it is that I need them myself I need them for my husband She
coloured at the avowal and went on hastily If he is to begin a new life and he has begun it already his first step ought to be to take back his children You must see that You must see how I am
situated Her voice broke and Boyne suddenly felt the same pity for her as when she had shown her fear that he might be hinting a criticism of Prince Buondelmonte s past
I ll do what I can only trust me he stammered
Judith came back and the Princess still a little rigid from the effort at self control began at once to thank her for her kindness and to say that she was afraid it was time to go She would tell Prince
Buondelmonte she added with an effort at cordiality that the children seemed very well physically well she explained and she would give him the assurance she hoped she might that some sort of
understanding as to their future would soon be reached
Victory or defeat Judith and Boyne sitting late asked each other which it was but found no answer

XXVIII ll the next day the rain continued It was one of those steady business like rains which seem in
mountain places not so much a caprice of the weather as the drop curtain punctually let down by Nature between one season and the next Behind its closely woven screen one had the sense of some
tremendous annual scene shifting the upheaval and overturning of everything in sight from the clouds bursting in snow on the cliff tops to the mattresses and blankets being beaten and aired in the
These images were doubtless born of Boyne s own mood When he opened his shutters on the morning after the Princess Buondelmonte s apparition it seemed to him as if she herself had hung that
cold gray mist before the window He was afraid of everything now of what the post might bring of what his own common sense might dictate to him above all of seeing Judith again and having his
apprehensions doubled by hers
The worst of it was that even should all their tormentors agree to leave them in peace they could not more particularly on Terry s account delay on that height through the coming weeks of storm
and rain Moreover all the hotels and pensions which would reopen later for the season of winter sports were preparing to close for their yearly cleaning and renovating After the middle of October
there would be no demand for accommodation till the arrival of the Christmas lugers and ski ers If it proved possible to keep the little Wheaters together any longer the best plan would probably be to
transport them to Riva or Meran till winter and fine weather were established together in the mountains
Boyne turned over these things with the nervous minuteness with which one makes plans for some one who is dying and will never survive to see them carried out It seemed to give him faith in the
future a sense of factitious security as it sometimes does beside a deathbed to think To morrow I ll see what the doctor says about a warmer climate
Judith and Miss Scope shared his idea about Meran or Riva and for some time had been talking vaguely of going down to look for rooms But the ever recurring difficulty of persuading a boardinghouse keeper to lodge seven children made them decide that it would be best to try to hire an
inexpensive villa The episode of the gold fish and the rabbit had not endeared them to their present landlady and they felt the hopelessness of trying to ingratiate themselves with another in a place
where they were unknown and where the autumn season would be at its height It had therefore been decided that Judith Miss Scope and Boyne should motor to Meran that very week to look over the
ground But on reflection Boyne hesitated to leave the children alone with their nurses even for so short an absence With Joyce in Paris once more reorganising her life and the Princess Buondelmonte
returning to Rome unsatisfied danger threatened on all sides Any one of these cross blasts might dash to earth the frail nest which had resisted the summer s breezes and Boyne heavy hearted set
out to call another council at the Pension Rosengl h
As he left the hotel a telegram was handed to him He glanced first at the signature Sarah Mervin then read what went before I will gladly receive own dear grandchildren subject to parents final
settlement of affairs fear cannot assume responsibility step children letter follows A lawyer s cable Boyne growled as he pocketed it That s the reason it s taken so long to compose
Fresh bitterness filled him as he saw one more prop withdrawn from under the crazy structure of his hopes These people he reflected all act on impulse where their own wants are concerned and call
in a lawyer when it s a question of anybody else s But in his heart he was not much surprised Mrs
Mervin was no longer young and it is natural for ageing people to shrink from responsibilities
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Besides she might well plead that it was no business of hers to take in children she had never seen
and whose parents were eager and financially able to care for them On second thoughts it really did not need Judith s bald hint as to the allowance her grandmother received from Cliffe Wheater to
account for the poor lady s attitude I don t see what else she could have done the impartial Boyne was obliged to admit in the course of his interminable argument with the other the passionate and
What a Utopia he and Judith had been dreaming He wondered now how he could have lent himself to such pure folly Well the dream was over and his was the grim business of making her see it
Heavily he went down the hill through the rain
At the pension Judith was watching for him from the window She opened the door and led him into the sitting room where a sulky fire smouldered puffing out acrid smoke The landlady said it was
always like that the stove always smoked on the first day of the autumn rains unless there was a little wind to make a draught And there was not a breath today the only way was to leave a window open
Judith explained as she turned to Boyne Her face was colourless and anxious he could see that she had been treading the wheel of the same problems as himself The sight made him resolve to try and
hide his own apprehensions a little longer
Well old Judy here we are after all and not a breach in the walls yet You mean she s gone the Princess
He nodded I saw her off to Rome an hour ago Her eyes brightened as they always did at his challenge but it was only a passing animation And
you haven t had any telegram she questioned
The question took him unprepared I why have you Yes From mother Here She produced the paper and thrust it feverishly into his hand Boyne s
anger rose evidently he thought old Mrs Mervin had waited to communicate with her daughter before answering him What cowardice what treachery He pictured all these grown up powers and
principalities leagued together against the handful of babes he commanded and the bitterness of surrender entered into him It was not that any of these parents really wanted their children If they
had the break up of Judith s dream though tragic would have been too natural to struggle against
But it was simply that the poor little things had become a bone of contention that the taking or keeping possession of them was a matter of pride or of expediency like fighting for a goal in some
exciting game or clinging to all one s points in an acrimoniously disputed law suit Boyne unfolded Mrs Wheater s telegram and read You must come to Paris immediately bringing Chip I must see
you at once do not disobey me stop telegraph Hotel Nouveau Luxe Mother The vague phrasing made it impossible to guess whether the message were the result of a cable from
Mrs Mervin or simply embodied a new whim of Joyce s Boyne on the whole inclined to the latter view and felt half ready to exonerate Mrs Mervin After all perhaps she had kept faith with him and
her message was only the result of her own scruples
He tossed the telegram onto the table with a shrug Is that all You ve heard nothing else Yes it appeared she had Nanny the day before had received a letter from Mrs Wheater s maid
Marguerite an experienced person who wielded a facile but rambling pen This letter Judith had coaxed from Nanny unknown to Miss Scope for Miss Scope even in the extremest emergencies
would not admit the possibility of her charges using as a means of information what the Princess would have called salaried assistants
Marguerite s news if vague was ample It appeared that Mrs Wheater had met in Venice a gentleman a good deal older than herself whose name the maid could not even approximately spell
but who was quite different from any of the other gentlemen in her mistress s circle
Different different how

to begin with But for God s sake why I thought she was chucking your father on account of Gerald
Judith went into this with the lucid impartiality she always applied to the analysis of her parents foibles She reminded Boyne that Joyce never stuck long to one thing and that she had decided to
marry Gerald chiefly in order to annoy her husband and to have an excuse for detaining the young tutor at the Lido when the children left He s rather a Lido man Gerald is Judith commented and
it made all the other women so furious That s always rather fun you know But after all she pursued her mother had much more sense than her poor father who was always
the prey of women like Zinnia Lacrosse or Sybil Lullmer She does pull herself together sometimes especially since that awful time with Buondelmonte And so when she met this other gentleman who
is so much older and very religious and enormously rich and who only wants to influence her for good Marguerite says it made her feel how dreadfully she d wasted her life and what a different
woman she might have been if she d known him years before You see he doesn t want to marry her but only to be her friend and adviser He thinks she s been married often enough And so in order not
to leave Gerald at a loose end she s kept him on as secretary till he can get another job and she and Gerald and the other gentleman have gone to Paris together to see what had better be done And the
gentleman says she ought to have us all with her and he feels awfully fond of us already and knows mother will be ever so much happier if we re with her
Oh my God then it s all up with us Boyne groaned
Judith made no answer and he went on It only remains now to hear from Lady Wrench and the Princess
Or Grandma Mervin there s still grandma Judith rejoined half hopefully
Boyne hesitated a moment then he said to himself that there was no use in any farther postponement No I ve heard from her he said
Judith s eyes were again illuminated You have Oh Martin If she d only take us all perhaps it would satisfy mother and the new gentleman Oh Martin she doesn t say no
Silently for no words came to him he gave her the cable and walked away to the window to be out of sight of her face For a while he stood watching the gray curtain of failure that hung there between
him and his golden weeks then he pulled himself together and turned back
Judy She handed him the cable
After all you expected it didn t you he said
She nodded It doesn t make so much difference anyhow he continued in an unconvinced voice if Bun and Beechy have to go
She pondered on this for a few moments without answering Then with one of her sudden changes of tone Martin she broke out impetuously do you suppose she was right after all I mean the
Princess about our being so dreadfully behind the times Do you suppose if we did all the things she suggested if we got new teachers and new books and somebody for Bun s gymnastics it would make
any difference do you think it would Every line of her face from lifted eyebrows to parted lips was a passionate demand for his assent After all you know perhaps she was right about some things
that stupid old book of Scopy s for instance Of course we all know poor darling Scopy s a back number And about Bun s gymnastics too Do you suppose if we took a villa at Meran we could afford
to fit up a room like the one she described and get an instructor didn t she call him an instructor
And then there s fencing and riding I dare say she was right about that too But after all she paused and her eyes looked as the rain did when the sun was trying to break through it After all
Martin she began again the main thing is that the children are so well isn t it Look at our record see what the summer has done You wouldn t know Terry would you if you were to see him now for

Nanny in the street to admire him and they always think he must be three years old He was just beginning to walk alone when he came here now he runs like a hare Nanny gets worn out chasing
him And the tricks he s learnt to do He can imitate everybody I believe he s going to be a movie star
Have you seen him do the lion with Bun as lion tamer Or the old man at the market all doubled up with sciatica who leans on a stick and holds one hand behind his back But it s a wonder Oh Martin
wait and I ll fetch him down now to do the old man for you shall I Once again her grown up cares had vanished in the childish pride of recounting Chip s
achievements Would it always be like this Boyne wondered or would life gradually close the gates of the fairyland which was still so close to her He would have given most of his chances of happiness to
help her keep open that communication with her childhood And what if he were the one being who could do it The question wound itself through his thoughts like a persuasive hand insinuating itself
into his This heart break of separation that was upon her what if he alone had the power to ease it
He stood looking down at her perplexedly
Judy Chip s a great man and I d love to see him do the old gentleman with the sciatica But first
Yes first she palpitated But under his gaze her radiance gradually faded and her lips began to tremble a little Ah then you don t think there s any hope for us
I think you ve got to go to Paris and see your mother And take Chip I ll never take Chip I won t
But listen dear He sat down and drew her to the sofa beside him speaking as he might have to a child on a holiday who was fighting the summons back to school
Listen Judy We ve done our best we all have But the children are not yours or mine They belong to their parents after all How dry and flat his phrases sounded compared with the words he longed
She drew back into the corner of the sofa That Buondelmonte woman s got at you she s talked you over I knew she would She was grown up again now measuring him with angry suspicious eyes and
flinging out her accusations in her mother s shrillest voice
Why child what nonsense You said just now that perhaps the Princess was right I never did I said perhaps we ought to get a new Cyclop dia for Scopy and have Bun taught
scientific gymnastics and now you say I say that fate s too much for us It didn t need the Princess Buondelmonte to teach me that
She made no answer and they sat in silence in their respective corners of the sofa each gazing desperately into a future of which nothing could be divined except that it was the end of their hopes
Suddenly Judith flung herself face down against the knobby cushions and broke into weeping Boyne for a few minutes remained numb and helpless then he moved closer and bending over drew her into
his arms She seemed hardly aware of his nearness she simply went on crying with hard uneven sobs pressing her face against his shoulder as if it were the sofa cushion He held her in silence not
venturing to speak or even to brush back her tumbled hair while he pictured with the acuity of his older and less articulate grief what must be passing before her as the fibres of her heart were torn
away It s too cruel it s too beastly cruel he thought wincing at the ugly details which must enter into her vision of the future details he could only guess at while she saw them with all the precision of
experience Yes it was too cruel but what could he or she do He continued to hold her in silence listening to the beat of the rain on the half open window and smelling the cold grave yard smell of the
autumn earth while her sobs ran through him in shocks of anguish
Gradually her weeping subsided and Boyne took courage to lift his hand and pass it once or twice over her hair She lay in his hold as quietly as a frightened bird and presently he bent his head and
whispered Judy Why not he thought his heart was beating with reckless bounds He was free

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html after all if it came to that free to chuck his life away on any madness and madness this was he knew
Well he d had enough of reason for the rest of his days and a man is only as old as he feels He bent so close that his lips brushed her ear Judy darling listen Perhaps after all there s a way
In a flash she was out of his arms and ecstatically facing him A way a way of keeping us all together Ah how hard her questions were to answer
Boyne drew her down again beside him Crying was a laborious and disfiguring business to her and her face was so drawn and tear stained that she looked almost old but its misery was shot through
with hope If he could have kept her there not speaking only answering her with endearments how easy how exquisite it would have been But her face was tense with expectation and he had to find
words for he knew that his silence would have no meaning for her
Judith he began but she interrupted Call me Judy or I shall think it s more bad news He made no answer and she flung herself against him with a cry of alarm Martin Martin You re not
going to desert us too He held her hands but his own had begun to tremble Darling I ll never desert you I ll stay with
you always if you ll have me if things go wrong I ll always be there to look after you and defend you no matter what happens we ll never be separated any more He broke off his voice failing before the
sudden sunrise in her eyes
Oh Martin She lifted his hands one by one to her wet cheeks and held them there in silent bliss
Then you don t belong any longer to Mrs Sellars I don t belong to any one but you for as long as ever you ll have me
Her eyes still bathed him in their radiance My darling my darling She leaned close as she said it and he dared not move in his new awe of her nearness so subtly had she changed from the child of
his familiar endearments to the woman he passionately longed for Darling she said again then with a face in which the bridal light seemed already kindled Oh Martin do you really mean you re
going to adopt us all and we re all going to stay with you forever

XXIX oyne felt like a man who has blundered along in the dark to the edge of a precipice He trembled
inwardly with the effort of recovery and the shock of finding himself flung back into his old world
Judith in a rush of gratitude had thrown her arms about him and he shrank from her touch from the warm smell of her hair from everything about her which he had to think back into terms of childhood
and comradeship while every vein in his body still ached for her There was nothing he would have dreaded as much as her detecting the least trace of what he was feeling His first care must be to hide
the break in their perfect communion the fact that for a moment she had been for him the woman she would some day be for another man in a future he could never share He undid her hands and walked
When he turned to her again he had struggled back to some sort of composure Judy child I wish you wouldn t take such terrible life leases on the future He tried to smile as he said it I m always
afraid it will bring us bad luck We d much better live from hand to mouth I m ready to promise all that a reasonable man can that I ll put up another big fight for you and that I don t despair of
winning it At any rate I ll be there I ll stand by you I won t desert you He broke off reading in her unsatisfied eyes the hopelessness of piling up vague assurances
Yes she assented in a voice grown as small and colourless as her face
He stood before her miserably You do understand dear don t you I m not sure She hesitated A little while ago I thought I did
His nerves began to twitch again Could he bear to go into the question with her once more and what would be the use if he did The immediate future must somehow or other be dealt with but the
last few minutes had deprived him of all will and energy He had the desolate sense of her knowing that he had failed her and yet not being able to guess why
Of course I ll do what I can he repeated
She remained silent constrained by his constraint and he saw the disappointment in her eyes
You don t believe me Still she looked at him perplexedly But you said I thought you said just now that you d found a
way of keeping us all together No matter what happened you had a plan you said His senseless irritation grew upon him Could such total simplicity be unfeigned Could she have
such a power of awaking passion without any inkling of its meaning He hated himself for doubting it
In time a short time perhaps her rich nature would come to its ripeness but as yet the only fullgrown faculties in it were her love for her brothers and sisters and her faith in the few people who had shown her kindness in a world unkindly
I m sorry she continued after pausing for an answer which did not come I must have misunderstood you I suppose
Boyne gave a nervous laugh You did most thoroughly And you won t tell me what you really meant
He stood motionless his hands in his pockets staring down at the knots in the wooden floor as he had stared at them on the day when she had owned to having taken her father s money but in a
mental perturbation how much deeper A few minutes before it had seemed like profanation to brush her with the thought of his love now faced by her despair by her sense of being left alone to fight her
battles he asked himself whether it might not be fairer even kinder to speak At the thought his heart

again began to beat excitedly Perhaps he had been too impetuous too inarticulate What if after all a word from him could wake the sleeping music
The difficulty was to find a beginning What would have been so simple if kisses could have told it seemed tortuous or brutal when put in words He shrank not so much from the possibility of hurting
her as from the sudden fear of her hurting him beyond endurance
Judith he began how old are you I shall be sixteen in three months no in five months really she said with an obvious effort at
As near as that Well sixteen is an age he laughed
She continued to fix her bewildered eyes on him as if seeking a clue But I look a lot older don t I she added hopefully
Older There are times when you look so old that you frighten me He remembered then that she had spoken to him with perfect simplicity of Gerald Ormerod s desire to marry her as of the most
natural thing in the world and his own scruples began to seem absurd I m always forgetting what a liberal education she s had he thought with a touch of self derision
He cleared his throat and continued So grown up that I suppose you ll soon be thinking of getting married
The word was out now it went sounding on and on inside of his head while he awaited her answer
When she spoke it was with an air of indifference and disappointment
What s the use of saying that How can I ever marry with all the children to look after It was clear that she regarded the subject as irrelevant her tone seemed to remind him that he and she had
long since dealt with and disposed of it You might as well tell me that I ought to be educated she grumbled
He pressed on But it might turn out you might find He had to pause to steady his voice If we can t prevent the children being taken away from you you ll be awfully lonely
Taken away from me At the word her listlessness vanished Do you suppose I ll let them be taken like that Without fighting to the very last minute Let Syb Lullmer get hold of Chip and Bun and
Beechy go to that Buondelmonte man I know It s hateful But supposing the very worst happens oughtn t you to face that now He
cleared his throat again If things went wrong and you were very lonely and a fellow asked you to marry him
Who asked me He laughed again If I did
For a moment she looked at him perplexedly then her eyes cleared and for the first time she joined in his laugh Hers seemed to bubble up fresh and limpid from the very depths of her little girlhood
Well that would be funny she said
There was a bottomless silence
Yes wouldn t it Boyne grinned He stared at her without speaking then like a blind man feeling his way he picked up his hat and mackintosh said Where s my umbrella Oh outside and walked
out stiffly into the passage On the doorstep still aware of her nearness he added a little dizzily No please I want a long tramp alone first I ll come in again this afternoon to settle what we d better do
about Paris He felt her little disconsolate figure standing alone behind him in the rain and hurried away as if to
put himself out of its reach forever

t was still raining when the Wheater colony left Cortina it was raining when the train in which Boyne and Judith were travelling reached Paris During the days intervening between the receipt of
Mrs Wheater s telegram and the clattering halt of the express in the gare de Lyon Boyne could not remember that the rain had ever stopped
But he had not had time to do much remembering not even of the havoc within himself After the struggle necessary to convince Judith that she must go to Paris and take Chip with her since
disobedience to her mother s summons might put them irretrievably in the wrong he had first had to help her decide what should be done with the other children Once brought round to his view she had
immediately risen to the emergency as she always did when practical matters were at stake She and Boyne were agreed that it would be imprudent to leave the children at Cortina where the Princess or
even Lady Wrench might take advantage of their absence to effect a raid on the pension It took a three days hunt to find a villa in a remote suburb of Riva where they could be temporarily installed
without much risk of being run down by an outraged parent Boyne put the Rosengl h landlady off the scent by giving her the address of Mrs Wheater s Paris banker and letting it be understood that
Judith was off to Paris to prepare for the children s arrival and Blanca and Terry still deep in Conan Doyle gleefully contributed misleading details
The excitement of departure and the business of establishing the little Wheaters in their new quarters left no time between Boyne and Judith for less pressing questions and Boyne saw that
once their plan was settled Judith was almost as much amused as the twins by its secret and adventurous side It will take a Dr Watson to nose them out won t it she chuckled as she and
Boyne with Chip and Susan scrambled into the Paris express at Verona It was not till they were in the train that Boyne saw the cloud of apprehension descend on her again But then fatigue intervened and
she fell asleep against his shoulder as peacefully as Chip who was curled up opposite with his head in Susan s lap As they sat there Boyne remembered how on the day of Mr Dobree s picnic he had
watched her sleeping by the waterfall a red glow in her cheeks velvet shadows under her lashes Now her face was pinched and sallow the lids were swollen with goodbye tears she seemed farther from
him than she had ever been yet more in need of him and at the thought something new and tranquillizing entered into him He had caught a glimpse of a joy he would never reach and he knew
that his eyes would always dazzle with it but the obligation of giving Judith the help she needed kept his pain in that deep part of the soul where the great renunciations lie
In Paris he left his companions at the door of the Nouveau Luxe where Mrs Wheater was established drove to his own modest hotel on the left bank and turned in for a hard tussle of thinking
He could no longer put off dealing with his own case for Mrs Sellars was still in Paris He had not meant to let her know of his arrival till the next day he needed the interval to get the fatigue and
confusion out of his brain But meanwhile he must map out some kind of a working plan must clear up his own mind and consider how to make it clear to her And after an unprofitable attempt at rest
and sleep and a weary tramp in the rain through the dusky glittering streets he suddenly decided on immediate action and turned into a telephone booth to call up Mrs Sellars She was at home and
answered immediately Aunt Julia was resting she said if he would come at once they could talk without fear of interruption
He caught the tremor of joy in her voice when he spoke her name but how like her how perfect of her to ask no questions to waste no time in exclamations just quietly and simply to say Come The
healing touch of her reasonableness again came to his rescue
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html He would have liked to find her close at hand on the very threshold of the telephone booth at the
rate at which his thoughts were spinning he knew he would have to go over the whole affair again in his transit to her hotel But there was no remedy for that he could only trust to her lucidity to help him
Aunt Julia s apartment was in a hotel of the rue de Rivoli with a row of windows overhanging the silvery reaches of the Tuileries gardens and the vista of domes and towers beyond The room was large
airy full of flowers A fire burned on the hearth Rose Sellars s touch was everywhere And a moment later she stood there before him incredibly slim and young looking in her dark dress and close little
hat Slightly paler perhaps and thinner but as she moved forward with her easy step the impression vanished He felt only her mastery of life and of herself and thought how much less she needed him
than did the dishevelled child he had just left The thought widened the distance between them and brought Judith abruptly closer
Well here I am he said and I ve failed He had prepared a dozen opening phrases but the sudden intrusion of Judith s face dashed them
all from his lips He was returning to ask forgiveness of the woman to whom he still considered himself engaged and his first word after an absence prolonged and unaccountable was to remind her of the
cause of their breach He saw the narrowing of her lips and then her victorious smile
Dear Tell me about it I want to hear everything she said holding out her hand
But he was still struggling in the coil of his blunder Oh never mind all that s really got nothing to do with it he stammered
She freed her hand and turned on the electric switch of the nearest lamp As she bent to it he saw that the locks escaping on each temple were streaked with gray The sight seemed to lengthen the days
of their separation into months and years He felt like a stranger coming back to her You ve forgiven me he began
She looked at him gravely What is it I have to forgive A lot you must think he said confusedly
She shook her head You re free you know We re just two old friends talking Sit down over there so She pointed to an armchair sat down herself and took off her hat In the lamplight under the
graying temples her face looked changed and aged like her hair But it was varnished over by her undaunted smile
Let us go back to where you began I want to hear all about the children She leaned her head thoughtfully on her hand in the attitude he had loved in the little sitting room at Cortina
I feel like a ghost he said
No for I should be a little afraid of you if you were a ghost and now Well now He looked about the pleasant firelit room saw her work basket in its usual place
near the hearth her books heaped up on a table and a familiar litter of papers on a desk in the window A ghost he repeated
She waited a moment and then said I wish you d tell me exactly what s been happening Oh everything s collapsed It was bound to And now I
He got up walked across the room glanced half curiously at the titles of some of the books and came back and leaned against the mantelpiece She sat looking up at him Yes
No I can t You can t what
Account for anything Explain anything He dropped back into his chair and threw his head back staring at the ceiling I ve been a fool and I m tired tired
Then we ll drop explanations Tell me only what you want she said

What he really wanted was not to tell her anything but to get up again and resume his inarticulate wanderings about the room With an effort of the will he remained seated and turned his eyes to hers
You ve been perfect and I do want to tell you to make you understand But no that sort of talk was useless He had better try to do what she had asked him About the children well the break up
was bound to come You were right about it of course But I was so sorry for the poor little devils that I tried to blind myself
His tongue was loosened and he found it easier to go on After all Mrs Sellars was right the story of the children must be disposed of first After that he might see more clearly into his own case and
hers He went on with his halting narrative and she listened in silence that rare silence of hers which was all alertness and sympathy She smiled a little over the Princess Buondelmonte s invasion and
sighed and frowned when he mentioned that Lady Wrench was also impending When he came to Mrs
Wheater s summons and his own insistence that Judith and Chip should immediately obey it she lifted her eyes and said approvingly But of course you were perfectly right
Was I I don t know When I left them just now at the door of that Moloch of a hotel She gave a little smile of reassurance No I don t think you need fear even the Nouveau Luxe I
understand what you re feeling but I think I can give you some encouragement Encouragement
About the future I mean Perhaps Mrs Wheater s news about herself is not altogether misleading
At any rate I know she s taken the best legal advice and I hear she may be able to keep all the children her own that is For of course the poor little steps
Boyne listened with a sudden start of attention He felt like some one shaken out of a lethargy
You ve seen her then I didn t know you knew her No I ve not seen her and I don t know her But a friend of mine does The fact is she ran across
Mr Dobree at the Lido after he left Cortina Dobree He stared incredulous as if he must have heard the wrong name
Yes hasn t she mentioned it to the children Ah no I remember she never writes Well she had the good sense to ask him to take charge of things for her and though he doesn t often accept new
cases nowadays he was so sorry for the children and for her too he says that he agreed to look after her interests And he tells me that if she follows his advice and keeps out of new entanglements he
thinks she can divorce Mr Wheater on her own terms and in that case of course the courts will give her all the children Isn t that the very best news I could give you
He tried to answer but again found himself benumbed Her eyes continued to challenge him It s more than you hoped she smiled
It s not in the least what I expected She waited for him to continue but he was silent again and she questioned suddenly What did you
expect He looked at her with a confused stare as if her face had become that of a stranger as familiar faces
do in a dream Dobree he said this Dobree She kindled You re very unfair to Mr Dobree Martin you always have been He s not only a great
lawyer whose advice Mrs Wheater is lucky to have but a kind and wise friend and a good man she added
Yes he said hardly hearing her All the torture of his hour of madness about Mr Dobree had returned to him He would have liked to leap up on the instant and go and find him and fight it out
I can t think she continued nervously what more you could have hoped He made a weary gesture God knows But what does it matter
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Matter Doesn t it matter to you that the children should be safe be provided for That in this new
crash they should remain with their mother and not be tossed about again from pillar to post If you didn t want that what did you want
I wanted somehow to get them all out of this hell I believe you exaggerate It s not going to be a hell if their mother keeps them as Mr Dobree thinks
she ll be able to You say yourself that she s fond of them Yes intermittently
And after all if the step children are taken back by their own parents that s only natural You say the new Princess Buondelmonte seems well meaning and kind in her way and as for Zinnie I
suppose Zinnie is the one of the party the best able to take care of herself I suppose so he acceded
Well then She paused and then repeated with a sharper stress I don t yet see what you want He looked about him with the same estranged stare with which his eyes had rested on her face
Something clear and impenetrable as a pane of crystal seemed to cut him off from her and from all that surrounded her He had been to the country from which travellers return with another soul
What I want Ah he knew that well enough What he wanted at the moment was just some opiate to dull the dogged ache of body and soul to close his ears against that laugh of Judith s and all
his senses to her nearness He was caught body and soul that was it and real loving was not the delicate distraction the food for dreams he had imagined it when he thought himself in love with Rose
Sellars it was this perpetual obsession this clinging nearness this breaking on the rack of every bone and tearing apart of every fibre And his apprenticeship to it was just beginning
Well there was one thing certain it was that he must get away as soon as he could from the friendly room and Rose s forgiving presence He tried to blunder into some sort of explanation I
don t suppose I ve any business to be here he began abruptly
Mrs Sellars was silent but it was not one of her speaking silences It was like a great emptiness slowly widening between them For a moment he thought she meant to force on him the task of
bridging it over then he saw that she was struggling with a pain as benumbing as his own She could not think of anything to say any more than he could and her helplessness moved him and brought her
nearer She wants to end it decently as I do he thought but his pity for her did not help him to find words
At length he got up and held out his hand You re the best friend I ve ever had and the dearest But I m going off on a big job somewhere I must At the other end of the world For a time
Yes she assented very low She did not take the hand he held out perhaps did not even see it
When two people part who have loved each other it is as if what happens between them befell in a great emptiness as if the tearing asunder of the flesh must turn at last into a disembodied anguish
You ve forgotten your umbrella she said as he reached the door He gave a little laugh as he came back to get it

XXXI he next day Boyne lunched at the Nouveau Luxe alone with Mrs Wheater and Judith He had
wondered if it would occur to Joyce that it might be preferable to lunch upstairs in her own rooms but it had not and his mind was too dulled with pain for him to care much for his
surroundings No crowd could make him feel farther away from Judith than the unseeing look in her own eyes
Mrs Wheater was dressed with a Quaker like austerity which made her look younger and handsomer than when he had last seen her in the rakish apparel of the Lido She had acquired another
new voice as she did with each new phase this time it was subdued and somewhat melancholy but less studied than the fluty tones she had affected in Venice Altogether Boyne had to admit that she
had improved that Mr Dobree s influence had achieved what others had failed to do After lunch they went upstairs and Joyce proposed to Judith that as the rain had stopped she should take Chipstone
and Susan to the Bois de Boulogne She herself wanted to have a quiet talk with dear Martin Judith could send the motor back to pick her up at four no at half past three She had promised to go to a
wonderful loan exhibition of Incunabula with Mr Dobree Judith nodded and disappeared with a faint smile at Boyne
Mr Dobree had opened her eyes to so many marvels Joyce continued when they were alone
Incunabula for instance would Boyne believe that she had never before heard of their existence Mr
Dobree had thought she must be joking when she asked him what they were But Martin knew how much chance she had had of cultivating herself in Cliffe s society Yes and she was beginning to
collect books first editions and to form a real library Didn t he think it would be a splendid thing for the children especially for Terry She blushed to think that while the family travelled over Europe in
steam yachts and Blue Trains and Rolls Royces poor Terry had had to feed on the rubbish Scopy could pick up for him in hotel libraries or the cabinets de lecture of frowsy watering places Mr
Dobree had been horrified when he found that Cliffe with all his millions had never owned a library
But then he didn t know Cliffe
Joyce went on to unfold her plans for the future She spoke as usual as if they were fixed and immutable in every detail She had decided to buy a place in the country near either Paris or Dinard
she wasn t sure which Probably Dinard on account of Terry s health The climate was mild and it was said that there were educational advantages If the sea was too strong for him she could find a house
somewhere inland But they must be near a town on account of the children s education and yet not in it because of the demoralising influences and the lack of good air In a few days she was going down to
look about her at Dinard
Boyne knew she supposed that she had begun divorce proceedings Of course she ought to have done it long ago but in that milieu one s moral sense got absolutely blunted Evidence Heavens
She already had more than enough to make her own terms Horrors and horrors There was no doubt Mr Dobree said that the courts would give her the custody of all the children And from now
on they would be the sole object of her life Didn t Boyne agree that at her age there couldn t be a more perfect conclusion Oh yes she knew she looked younger than she really was but there were
gray streaks in her hair already hadn t he noticed And she wasn t going to dye it not she She was going to let herself turn frankly into an old woman She didn t mind the idea a bit Middle age was so
full of duties and interests of its own she had a perfect horror of the women who are always dyeing and drugging themselves in the hopeless attempt to keep young like that pitiable Syb Lullmer for
instance She had learned thank heaven that there were other things in life And her first object of course was to get the children away from hotels and hotel contacts from all the Nouveaux Luxes and

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html the Palaces She was counting the minutes till she could create a real home for them and make them
so happy that they would never want to leave it She knew Boyne would approve The monologue ended by her expressing her gratitude for all he had done for the children and her delight at being
reunited to Judith and Chip Chip oh he was a wonder so fat and tall and walking and talking like a boy of four And Judith told her it was all thanks to Boyne
Mrs Wheater seemed genuinely sorry to think that Bun and Beechy would probably have to return to their father But perhaps she added if the new Princess Buondelmonte was so full of good
intentions and so determined to have her own way the two children might get a fairly decent bringing up Buondelmonte wasn t as young as he had been and might be glad to settle down if his
wife made him comfortable and let him have enough money to gamble at his club And as for Zinnie Joyce shrugged and doubted if either her mother or Cliffe would really take Zinnie on when it came to
the point She was rather a handful Zinnie was no one but Judy could control her Still grieved as Joyce would be to give up the steps poor little souls she was too much used to human ingratitude
not to foresee that they might be taken from her at any moment But her own children no Never again Of that Boyne might be assured She had learned her lesson her eyes had been opened to her
own folly and imprudence and Mr Dobree had absolutely promised her oh by the way wasn t Martin going to stay and see Mr Dobree who would be turning up at any minute now to take her to
see the Incunabula She thought he and Martin had met at Cortina hadn t they Yes she remembered Mr Dobree had been so struck by Martin s devotion to the children She hoped so much
they might meet again and make friends Boyne thanked her and thought perhaps another time
but he was leaving Paris probably he couldn t wait then He got himself out of the room in a confusion of excuses
All day he wandered through the streets inconsolably His will power seemed paralysed He was determined to get away from Paris at once to go to New York first in quest of a job and then to
whatever end of the world the job should call him There was no object in his lingering where he was for another hour He and Rose Sellars had said their last word to each other and to Judith herself
what more had he to say Yet he could not submit his mind to the idea that his happy unreal life of the last weeks was over that he would never again enter the pension at Cortina and see the little Wheaters
flocking about him in a tumult of welcome begging for a romp a game a story clamouring to have their quarrels arbitrated demanding to be taken on a picnic with Judith serene above the tumult or
laughing and twittering with the rest When he grew too tired to walk farther he turned in at a postoffice and wrote a cable which he had been revolving for some hours It was addressed to the New York contractors who had written to ask if he could trace the young engineer who had been his
assistant Luckily he had not been able to and he cabled Should like for myself the job you wrote about Can I have it Can start at once Cable bankers
This message despatched he turned to the telephone booth rang up the Nouveau Luxe and asked to speak to Miss Wheater Interminable minutes passed after he had put in his call Mrs Wheater s
maid was found first who didn t know where Judith was or how to find her then Susan who said Judith had come back and gone out again and that all she knew was that the ladies were going to dine
out that evening with Mr Dobree and go to the theatre Then just as Boyne was turning away discouraged Judith s own voice Hullo Martin Where are you When can I see you
Now if you can come I m off tonight to London He suddenly found he had decided that without knowing it
She exclaimed in astonishment and asked where she was to meet him and he acquiesced in her suggestion that it should be at a tea room near her hotel as it was so late that she would soon have to
hurry back for dinner He jumped into a taxi secured a table in a remote corner of the tea room and met her on the threshold a moment later It was already long after six and the rooms were emptying
in a few minutes they would have the place to themselves
Judith a little flushed with the haste of her arrival looked gracefully grown up in her dark coat edged with fur a pretty antelope bag in her gloved hand The bareheaded girl of the Dolomites in

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html sports frock and russet shoes had been replaced by a demure young woman who seemed to Boyne
Martin You re not really going away tonight she began at once not noticing his request that she should choose between tea cakes and clairs
He said he was for a few days at any rate the mere sound of her voice the look in her eyes had nearly dissolved his plans again and his own voice was unsteady
The fact that it was only for a few days seemed to reassure Judith He d be back by the end of the week she hoped wouldn t he Yes oh yes he said very probably
Because you know the children ll be here by that time she announced and turning her attention to the trays presented Oh both I think yes I ll take both
The children Yes mother s just settled it Mr Dobree wrote the wire for her If Nanny gets it in time they re to
start to morrow Mr Dobree thinks we may be able to keep the steps too he s going to write himself to Buondelmonte And he doesn t believe the Wrenches will ever bother us about Zinnie at least not
at present He s found out a lot of things about Lord Wrench and he thinks Zinnia ll have her hands full with him without tackling Zinnie too
She spoke serenely almost lightly as if all her anxieties had been dispelled Could it be that the mere change of scene the few hours spent with her mother had so completely reassured her She
who had always measured Joyce with such precocious insight was it possible that she was deluded by her now Or had she too succumbed to Mr Dobree s mysterious influence Boyne looked at her
careless face and wondered
But this Dobree you didn t fancy him much at Cortina What makes you believe in him now She seemed a little puzzled and wrinkled her brows in the effort to find a reason I don t know He s
funny looking of course and rather pompous And I do like you heaps better Martin But he s been most awfully good about the children and he can make mother do whatever he tells her And she says
he s a great lawyer and his clients almost always win their cases Oh Martin wouldn t it be heavenly if he could really keep us together steps and all He s sworn to me that he will She turned her radiant
eyes on Boyne Anyhow the children will be here the day after to morrow and that will be splendid won t it You must get back from London as soon as ever you can and take us all off somewhere for
the day just as if we were still at Cortina Yes of course he would Boyne said on Scopy s book he would She lit up at that asking where
they d better go and finally settling that if the rain ever held up a day at Versailles would be jollier than anything But it must be soon she reminded him because in a few days Mrs Wheater was
going to carry them all off to Dinard
Yes she pursued she really did feel that Mr Dobree just in a few weeks had gained more influence over her mother than any one else ever had Judith had had a long talk with him that morning and he
had told her frankly that he was doing it all out of interest in the children and because he wanted to help her wasn t that dear of him Anyhow they were all going to stand together grown ups and
children and put up a last big fight On Scopy s book Boyne interpolated with a strained smile And they were to have a big house in the country with lots of dogs and horses she continued And the
children were never to go to hotels any more And Terry was to have a really first rate tutor and be sent to school in Switzerland as soon as he was strong enough in another year perhaps
Boyne sat watching her with insatiable eyes She looked so efficient so experienced yet what could be surer proof of her childishness than this suddenly revived faith in the future He saw that whoever
would promise to keep the children together would gain a momentary hold over her as he once had alas And he saw also that the mere change of scene the excitement of the flight from Cortina the
encouragement which her mother s new attitude gave her were so many balloons lifting her up into the blue It will be Versailles don t you think so she began again Or if it rains deluges what
about the circus and a big tea afterward somewhere where Chip and Nanny could come too She
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html looked at him with her hesitating smile I thought perhaps if you didn t mind but no darling she
broke off decisively we won t ask Mr Dobree Lord I should hope not not if I m giving the party He found the voice and laugh she expected
gave her back her banter discussed and fixed with her the day and hour of the party And all the while there echoed in his ears more insistently than anything she was saying a line or two from the chorus
of Lemures in Faust which Rose had read aloud one evening at Cortina

always known it An episode he thought it s been only an episode One of those things that come up out of the sea on a full moon night playing the harp Yes but sometimes the episodes last and the
things one thought eternal wither like grass and only the gods know which it will be if they do
L addition mademoiselle Good Lord child four clairs And a Dobree dinner in the offing Ah thrice happy infancy as the poet said Yes here s your umbrella Take my arm and we ll nip round

From the threshold of the hotel she called to him rosy under her shining umbrella Thursday morning then you ll fetch us all at ten And he called back On Scopy s book I will as the rain
On the day fixed for the children s picnic Boyne lay half asleep on the deck of a South American liner It was better so a lot better The morning after he had parted from Judith at the door of the
Nouveau Luxe the summons had come Job yours please sail immediately for Rio particulars on arrival and he had just had time to pitch his things into his portmanteaux catch the first train for
London and scramble on board his boat at Liverpool
A lot better so The busy man s way of liquidating hopeless situations It reminded him of the old times when at the receipt of such a summons cares and complications fell from him like dust from a
shaken garment It would not be so now his elasticity was gone Yet already after four days at sea he was beginning to feel a vague solace in the empty present and in the future packed with duties No
hesitating speculating wavering to and fro he was to be caught as soon as he landed and thrust into the stiff harness of his work And meanwhile more and more miles of sea were slipping in between
him and the last months making them already seem remote and vapoury compared with the firm outline of the future
The day was mild with a last touch of summer on the lazy waves over which they were gliding He closed his eyes and slept
At Versailles too it was mild there were yellow leaves still on the beeches of the long walks they formed golden tunnels with hazy blueish vistas where the park melted into the blur of the forest But
the gardens were almost deserted it was too late in the season for the children chasing their hoops and balls down the alleys the groups of nurses knitting and gossiping on wooden chairs under the great
stone Dianas and Apollos
Funny he and the little Wheaters seemed to have the lordly pleasure grounds to themselves The clipped walls of beech and hornbean echoed with their shouts and laughter What a handful the little
Wheaters were getting to be Terry now could run and jump with the rest and as for Chip rounder than ever in a white fur coat and tasselled cap his waddle was turning into a scamper
In the sun under a high protecting hedge Miss Scope and Nanny sat and beamed upon their children and Susan flew down the vistas after Chip

summer with vacant faced divinities niched in green broken arcades toy temples deserted of their gods On this November day when mist was everywhere mist trailing through the half bare trees
lying in a faint bloom on the lichened statues oozing up from the layers of leaves underfoot the place seemed the ghostly setting of dead days Boyne looked down at Judith and even her face was
ghostly Come he said with a shiver let s get back into the sun Outside of the bosquet down the alley the children came storming toward them shouting laughing and wrangling Boyne laughing
too caught up the furry Chip and swung him high in air Bun to attract his attention turned a new somersault at his feet and Zinnie and Beechy squealed Martin now s the time for presents For
since the Princess Buondelmonte had been so shocked by their cupidity it had become a joke with the children to be always petitioning for presents

XXXII oyne was coming back from Brazil His steamer was approaching Bordeaux moving up the estuary
of the Gironde under a September sky as mild as the one which had roofed his sleep when nearly three years earlier he had dreamt he was at Versailles with the little Wheaters
Three years of work and accomplishment lay behind him And the job was not over that was the best of it A touch of fever had disabled him and he was to take a few weeks holiday in Europe and
then return to his task His first idea had been to put in this interval of convalescence in America to take the opportunity to look up his people and see a few old friends in New York But he was sure to
find Rose Sellars in New York or near it he could hardly go there without being obliged to see her
And the time for that had not yet come if it ever would He looked at his grizzled head his sallow features with brown fever blotches under the skin and put away the idea with a grimace The tropics
seemed fairly to have burnt him out
Rose Sellars had been kind she had been perfect as he had foreseen she would be He knew that after a winter on the Nile with Aunt Julia she had returned to her own house in New York for once
re established there she had begun to write to him again From her letters which were free from all recriminations all returning to the past he learned that she had taken up her old life again the
reading the social round the small preoccupations But he saw her going through the old routine with transparent hands and empty eyes as he could picture the ghosts of good women doing in the world of
His own case was more fortunate His eyes were full of visions of work to be his hands of the strength of work done Yet at times he too felt tenuous and disembodied Since the fever particularly
it was always disastrous to him to have to interrupt his work And this flat soft shore that gave him welcome so safe so familiar how it frightened him He didn t want to come in contact with life
again and life always wooed him when he was not at work
It was odd how little of late he had thought of the Wheaters At first the memory of them had been a torture an obsession But luckily he had not given his address to Judith and so she had not been
able to write and Mrs Sellars had never once alluded to the children His work in Brazil lay up country far from towns and post offices but bundles of American newspapers straggled in at
uncertain intervals and from one he had learned that the Wheater divorce had been pronounced in Mrs Wheater s favour from another about a year later that Cliffe had married Mrs Lullmer There
had been an end of the story and Boyne had lived long enough to know that abrupt endings were best
As his steamer pushed her way up the estuary he was still asking himself how he should employ his holiday All his thoughts were with his interrupted work with the man who had temporarily replaced
him and of whose judgment and temper he was not quite sure He could not as yet bring himself to consider his own plans for the coming weeks because till he could get back to Brazil everything that
might happen to him seemed equally uninteresting and negligible
At dinner that evening at the famous Chapeau Rouge of Bordeaux the fresh truffles cooked in white wine and washed down with a bottle of Ch teau Margaux insensibly altered his mood He had
forgotten what good food could be like His view of life was softened and even the faces of the people at the other tables commonplace as they were gradually began to interest him At the steamer landing
the walls were plastered over with flamboyant advertisements of the watering places of the Basque coast Cibour Hendaye St Jean de Luz Biarritz A band of gay bathers on a white beach under
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html striped umbrellas was labelled Hendaye another of slim ladies silhouetted on a terrace against a
cobalt sea while their partners absorbed cocktails at little tables stood for Biarritz The scene recalled to Boyne similar spectacles all the world over casinos dancing gambling the monotonous rattle and
glare of cosmopolitan pleasure And suddenly he felt that to be in such a crowd was what he wanted a crowd of idle insignificant people not one of whom he would ever care to see again He fancied the
idea of bands playing dancers undulating over polished floors expensive food served on flowery terraces high play in crowded over heated gaming rooms It was the lonely man s flight from himself
the common impulse of hard workers on first coming out of the wilderness He took the train for Biarritz
The place was in full season but he found a room in a cheap hotel far from the sea and forthwith began to mix with the crowd At first his deep inner loneliness cut him off from them that people
should be leading such lives seemed too absurd and inconsequent But gradually the glitter took him as it often had before after a long bout of hard work and isolation he enjoyed the feeling of being lost
in the throng alone and unnoticed with no likelihood of being singled out like Uncle Edward for some agreeable adventure
Adventure He had come to hate the very word His one taste of the thing had been too bitter All he wanted now was to be amused and he hugged his anonymity For three days he wandered about in
caf s on terraces above the sea and in the gaming rooms He even made an excursion across the Spanish border but he came back from it tired and dispirited Solitude and scenery were not what he
wanted he plunged into the Medley again
On the fourth day he saw the announcement Gala Dinner and Dance tonight at the Mirasol The Mirasol was the newest and most fashionable hotel in Biarritz the Palace of the moment The idea
of assisting at the gala dinner took Boyne s fancy and in the afternoon he strolled up to the hotel to engage a table But they were all bespoken and he sat down in the hall to glance over some illustrated
papers The place at that hour was nearly empty but presently he heard a pipe of childish laughter coming from the corner where the lift was caged Several liveried lift boys were hanging about in
idleness and among them was a little girl with long legs incredibly short skirts and a fiery bush of hair Boyne laid down his paper and looked at her but her back was turned to him She was wrestling
with the smallest of the lift boys while the others looked on and grinned Presently a stout lady descended from a magnificent motor entered the hotel and walked across the hall to the lift Instantly
the boys stood to attention and the red haired child quiet as a mouse slipped into the lift after the stout lady and shot up out of sight When the lift came down again she sprang out and instantly
resumed her romp with the boys This time her face was turned toward Boyne and he saw that she was Zinnie Wheater He got up from his chair to go toward her but another passenger was getting into the
lift and Zinnie followed and disappeared again The next time it came down two or three people were waiting for it Zinnie slipped in among them flattening herself into a corner Boyne sat and watched
her appearing and disappearing in this way for nearly an hour it was evidently her way of spending the afternoon And not for the first time presumably for several of the passengers recognised her and
greeted her with a nod or a joke One fat old gentleman in spats produced a bag of sweets and pinched her bare arm as he gave it to her and a lady in black with a little girl drew the latter close to her and
looked past Zinnie as if she had not been there
At last there came a lull in the traffic the attendants relapsed into lassitude and Zinnie after circling aimlessly about the hall slipped behind the porter s desk inspected the letters in the
mahogany pigeon holes against the wall and began to turn over the papers on the desk Then she caught sight of the porter approaching from a distance slid out from behind the desk waltzed down
the length of the hall and back and stopped with a yawn just in front of Boyne For a moment she did not seem to notice him but presently she sidled up leaned over his shoulder and said persuasively
May I look at the pictures with you He laid the paper aside and glanced up at her She stared a moment or two perplexedly and then
flushed to the roots of her hair Martin why I believe it s old Martin
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Yes it s old Martin but you re a new Zinnie aren t you he rejoined
Her eyes were riveted on him he saw that she was half shy half eager to talk She perched on the arm of his chair and took his neck in her embrace as Judith used to
Well it s a long time since I saw you I m lots older and you are too she added reflectively I don t believe you d have known me if I hadn t spoken to you would you
Not if you hadn t had that burning bush he said touching her hair His voice was trembling he could hardly see her for the blur in his eyes If he closed his lids he might almost imagine that the thin
arm about his neck was Judith s
Well how s everybody he asked a little hoarsely
Oh awfully well said Zinnie But you don t look very well yourself she added turning a sidelong glance on him
Never mind about me Are you here together all of you or have the others stayed at Dinard Dinard She seemed to be puzzled by the question
Wasn t your mother going to buy a house in the country near Dinard Was she I dunno We ve never had a house of our own said Zinnie
Never anywhere No I guess it would only bother mother to have a house She likes hotels better She s married
again you know and she s getting fat Married
Didn t you know about that either How funny She s married to Mr Dobree said Zinnie swinging her legs against Boyne s chair
Boyne sat silent and she continued her eyes wandering over him critically I guess you ve had a fever haven t you or else something bad with your liver
Nothing of the sort I was never better But you re all here then I suppose His heart stood still as he made a dash at the question
Yes we re all here said Zinnie indifferently At least Terry s at school in Switzerland you see and Blanca s at a convent in Paris cos she got engaged again to a lift boy who was a worse rotter than the
first and Bun and Beechy are in Rome in their father s palace They hate writing so we don t actually know how they are
Ah Boyne commented He looked away from her staring across the deserted hall But Chip s here he asked
Zinnie shook her red curls gravely No he isn t here either She hesitated a moment swinging her legs He s buried she said
Buried Didn t you know that either You ve been ever so far away I suppose Chip got menin meningitis
isn t it We were at Chamonix for Terry The doctors couldn t do anything It was last winter no the winter before We all cried awfully we wore black for three months And so after that mother decided
she d better marry Mr Dobree because she was too lonely she said Ah lonely
Yes and so after a while we came to Paris and she was married It must have been two years ago because the steps were with us still and Beechy and I wore little pink dresses at the wedding and Bun
was page I wonder you didn t see our photographs in the Herald Don t you ever read the Herald Not often Boyne had to admit
Zinnie continued to swing her legs against the side of his chair And it s then we found out what Mr
Dobree s Christian name is she rambled on We had work doing it but Terry managed to see the papers he had to sign the day of the wedding and so we found out His name s Azariah We never
PM The Children Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
thought of that did we It s the name of a man who made millions in mines so I s pose when he died he left all his money to Mr Dobree
Made millions in mines Well that s what Scopy said She said Not know that You little heathens Why of course Azariah
was a minor prophet Oh of course naturally Boyne murmured swept magically back to the world of joyous
incongruities in which he had lived enchanted with the little Wheaters
So we think that s why he s so rich and why mother married him Zinnie concluded with a final kick on the side of the chair then she slid down put her hands on her hips pirouetted in front of
Boyne and held out the bag of pink glazed paper which the old gentleman who wore spats had given her Have a chocolate The ones in gold paper have got liqueur in em she said Boyne shook his
head and she continued to look at him attentively At last Martin darling aren t those Abdullahs you re smoking Will you let me have one she said in a coaxing voice
Let you have one You don t mean to say you smoke No but I have a friend who does Boyne held out his cigarette case with a shrug and she drew out
a small handful and flitted away to the lift When she came back her face was radiant It s awfully sweet of you she said You always were an old darling Don t you want to come upstairs and see
mother She was a little tired after lunch so I don t believe she s gone out yet Boyne got to his feet with a gesture of negation Sorry my dear but I m afraid I can t I fact is I m
just here for a few hours taking the train back to Bordeaux presently he stammered
Oh are you That s too bad Mother will be awfully sorry and so will Judy Boyne cleared his throat and brought out abruptly Ah she s here too Judy
Zinnie stared at the question Course she is Only just today she s off on an excursion with some P ruvians They ve got an awfully long name I can t remember it They have two Rolls Royces She
won t be back not till just before dinner She ll have to be back then because she s got a new dress for the dance tonight It s a pity you can t come back and see her in it
Yes it s a pity But I can t He held out his hand and she put her little bony claw into it Goodbye child he said then abruptly he bent down to her Kiss me Zinnie She held up her merry face and
he laid his lips on her cheek Goodbye he repeated
He had really meant while he talked with her to go back to his hotel and pack up and catch the next train for anywhere The place was like a tomb to him now under all the noise and glitter his past
was buried He walked away with hurried strides from the Mirasol but when he got back to his own hotel he sat down in his room and stared about him without making any effort to pack He sat there for
a long time for all the rest of the afternoon without moving Once he caught himself saying aloud
She s got a new dress for the dance He laughed a little at the thought and became immersed in his memories
Boyne dined at a restaurant he didn t remember where turned in at a cinema for an hour and then got into his evening clothes and walked up through the warm dark night to the Mirasol The
great building shining with lights loomed above a tranquil sea music drifted out from it and on the side toward the sea its wide terrace was thronged with ladies in bright dresses and their partners
Boyne walked up among them but as he reached the terrace a drizzling rain began to fall and laughing and crying out the dancers all hurried back into the hotel He stood alone on the damp
flagging and paced up and down slowly before the uncurtained windows The dinner was over the restaurant was empty and through the windows he saw the waiters preparing the tables again for
supper Farther on he passed other tall windows giving on a richly upholstered drawing room where
PM The Children Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html groups of elderly people at tables with shaded lamps were playing bridge and poker Among them he
noticed a stout lady in a low necked black dress Her much exposed back was turned to him and he recognised the shape of her head the thatch of rippled hair silver white now she had kept her resolve
of not dyeing it and the turn of her white arms as she handled her cards Opposite her sat her partner also white headed in a perfectly cut dinner jacket the lamplight seemed to linger
appreciatively on his lustrous pearl studs and sleeve links It was Mr Dobree grown stouter too with a reddish fold of flesh above his immaculate collar The couple looked placid well fed and perfectly
satisfied with life and with each other
Boyne continued his walk and turning an angle of the building found himself facing the windows of the ballroom The terrace on that side being away from the sea was but faintly lit and the spectacle
within seemed therefore more brilliantly illuminated
At first he saw only a blur of light and colour couples revolving slowly under the spreading chandeliers others streaming in and out of the doorways or grouped about the floor in splashes of
brightness The music rose and fell in palpitating rhythms paused awhile and began again in obedience to a rattle of hand clapping The floor was already crowded but Boyne s eyes roved in vain
from one slender bare armed shape to another then he said to himself But it s nearly three years since I saw her She s grown up now perhaps I m looking at her without knowing her
The thought that one of those swaying figures might be Judith s that at that very instant she might be gazing out at him with unknown eyes sent such a pang through him that he moved away again into
the darkness The rain had almost ceased but a faint wind from the sea drove the wet air against his face he might almost have fancied he was crying The pain of not seeing her was unendurable It
seemed to empty his world
He heard voices and steps approaching behind him on the terrace and to avoid being scrutinised he mechanically turned back to the window And there she was close to him on the other side of the pane
moving across the long reflections of the floor And he had imagined that he might not know her
She had just stopped dancing the arm of a very tall young man with a head as glossy as his shirtfront detached itself from her waist She was facing Boyne now she was joining a group near his window Two or three young girls greeted her gaily as she passed them The centre of the room was
being cleared for a pair of professional dancers and Judith waving away a gilt ballroom chair which somebody proffered remained standing clustered about by other slender and glossy young men
Boyne from without continued to gaze at her
He had not even asked himself if she had changed if she had grown up He had totally forgotten his fear that he might not recognise her He knew now that if she had appeared to him as a bent old
woman he would have known her He watched her with a passionate attentiveness Her silk dress was of that peculiar carnation pink which takes a silver glaze like the bloom on a nectarine The rich
stuff stood out from her in a double tier of flounces on which as she stood motionless her hands seemed to float like birds on little sunlit waves Her hair was moulded to her head in close curves like
the ripples of a brown stream Instead of being cut short in the nape it had been allowed to grow and was twisted into a figure eight through which was thrust an old fashioned diamond arrow Her throat
and neck were bare and so were her thin arms but a band of black velvet encircled one of her wrists relieving the tender rose and amber of her dress and complexion Her eyes seemed to Boyne to have
grown larger and more remote but her mouth was round and red as it always was when she was amused or happy While he watched her one of the young men behind her bent over to say something
As she listened she lifted a big black fan to her lips and her lids closed for a second as they did when she wanted to hold something sweet between them But when she furled the fan her expression
changed and her face suddenly became as sad as an autumn twilight
Judith Boyne thought as if her being Judith her being herself were impossible to believe yet too sweet for anything else in the world to be true It was one of her moments of beauty that fitful
beauty which is so much more enchanting and perilous than the kind that gets up and lies down every day with its wearer This might be Boyne said to himself literally the only day the only hour in

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html which the queer quarrelling elements that composed her would ever join hands in a celestial harmony
It did not matter what had brought the miracle about Perhaps she was in love with the young man who had bent over her and was going to marry him Or perhaps she was still a child pleased at her
new dress and half proud half frightened in the waking consciousness of her beauty and the power it exercised Whichever it was Boyne knew he would never know He drew back into an unlit corner of
the terrace and sat there a long time in the dark his head thrown back and his hands locked behind it
Then he got up and walked away into the night
Two days afterward the ship which had brought him to Europe started on her voyage back to Brazil
On her deck stood Boyne a lonely man

A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA I
To Sherlock Holmes she is always the woman I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name
In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler All emotions and that one particularly were abhorrent to his cold precise but admirably
balanced mind He was I take it the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position He never spoke of the softer passions save with a
gibe and a sneer They were admirable things for the observer excellent for drawing the veil from men s motives and actions But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely
adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results Grit in a sensitive instrument or a crack in one of his own high power lenses would not be more
disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his And yet there was but one woman to him and that woman was the late Irene Adler of dubious and questionable memory
I had seen little of Holmes lately My marriage had drifted us away from each other My own complete happiness and the home centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his
own establishment were sufficient to absorb all my attention while Holmes who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul remained in our lodgings in Baker Street buried among his old books and
alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition the drowsiness of the drug and the fierce energy of his own keen nature He was still as ever deeply attracted by the study of crime and occupied his immense
faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police From time to time I heard some vague account of
his doings of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and
successfully for the reigning family of Holland Beyond these signs of his activity however which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press I knew little of my former friend and companion
One night it was on the twentieth of March I was returning from a journey to a patient for I had now returned to civil practice when my way led me through Baker Street As I passed the well remembered
door which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again and to know how he was employing his
extraordinary powers His rooms were brilliantly lit and even as I looked up I saw his tall spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind He was pacing the room swiftly eagerly with his head sunk upon his
chest and his hands clasped behind him To me who knew his every mood and habit his attitude and manner told their own story He was at work again He had risen out of his drug created dreams and was hot upon the
scent of some new problem I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own
His manner was not effusive It seldom was but he was glad I think to see me With hardly a word spoken but with a kindly eye he waved me to an armchair threw across his case of cigars and indicated a spirit case
and a gasogene in the corner Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion
Wedlock suits you he remarked I think Watson that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you
Seven I answered
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Indeed I should have thought a little more Just a trifle more I fancy Watson And in practice again I observe You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness
Then how do you know I see it I deduce it How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately and that you have a
most clumsy and careless servant girl My dear Holmes said I this is too much You would certainly have been burned had you lived a few
centuries ago It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess but as I have changed my clothes I can t imagine how you deduce it As to Mary Jane she is incorrigible and my wife has
given her notice but there again I fail to see how you work it out He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long nervous hands together
It is simplicity itself said he my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe just where the firelight strikes it the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts Obviously they have been caused by someone who has
very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it Hence you see my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather and that you had a particularly malignant boot slitting
specimen of the London slavey As to your practice if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger and a bulge on the right side of his top hat to
show where he has secreted his stethoscope I must be dull indeed if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession
I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction When I hear you give your reasons I remarked the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it
myself though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours
Quite so he answered lighting a cigarette and throwing himself down into an armchair You see but you do not observe The distinction is clear For example you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the
hall to this room Frequently
How often Well some hundreds of times
Then how many are there How many I don t know
Quite so You have not observed And yet you have seen That is just my point Now I know that there are seventeen steps because I have both seen and observed By the way since you are interested in these little
problems and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences you may be interested in this He threw over a sheet of thick pink tinted notepaper which had been lying open upon the
table It came by the last post said he Read it aloud The note was undated and without either signature or address
There will call upon you to night at a quarter to eight o clock it said a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have
shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated This account of you we have from all quarters received Be in your chamber then at that hour and
do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask This is indeed a mystery I remarked What do you imagine that it means
I have no data yet It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has data Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories instead of theories to suit facts But the note itself What do you deduce from it
I carefully examined the writing and the paper upon which it was written
The man who wrote it was presumably well to do I remarked endeavouring to imitate my companion s processes Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet It is peculiarly strong and stiff
Peculiar that is the very word said Holmes It is not an English paper at all Hold it up to the light PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html I did so and saw a large E with a small g a P and a large G with a small t woven into the texture of
What do you make of that asked Holmes
The name of the maker no doubt or his monogram rather Not at all The G with the small t stands for Gesellschaft which is the German for Company It is a
customary contraction like our Co P of course stands for Papier Now for the Eg Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves Eglow Eglonitz here we are
Egria It is in a German speaking country in Bohemia not far from Carlsbad Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein and for its numerous glass factories and paper mills Ha ha my boy what do you
make of that His eyes sparkled and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette
The paper was made in Bohemia I said
Precisely And the man who wrote the note is a German Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence This account of you we have from all quarters received A Frenchman or Russian could not have
written that It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs It only remains therefore to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face And
here he comes if I am not mistaken to resolve all our doubts As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses hoofs and grating wheels against the curb followed by a
sharp pull at the bell Holmes whistled
A pair by the sound said he Yes he continued glancing out of the window A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties A hundred and fifty guineas apiece There s money in this case Watson if there is nothing
else I think that I had better go Holmes
Not a bit Doctor Stay where you are I am lost without my Boswell And this promises to be interesting It would be a pity to miss it
But your client Never mind him I may want your help and so may he Here he comes Sit down in that armchair Doctor
and give us your best attention A slow and heavy step which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage paused immediately outside
the door Then there was a loud and authoritative tap
Come in said Holmes
A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height with the chest and limbs of a Hercules His dress was rich with a richness which would in England be looked upon as akin to bad taste
Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double breasted coat while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame coloured silk and secured at the neck with
a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl Boots which extended halfway up his calves and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was
suggested by his whole appearance He carried a broad brimmed hat in his hand while he wore across the upper part of his face extending down past the cheekbones a black vizard mask which he had apparently adjusted that
very moment for his hand was still raised to it as he entered From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character with a thick hanging lip and a long straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the
length of obstinacy
You had my note he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent I told you that I would call He looked from one to the other of us as if uncertain which to address
Pray take a seat said Holmes This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases Whom have I the honour to address
You may address me as the Count Von Kramm a Bohemian nobleman I understand that this gentleman your friend is a man of honour and discretion whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance If not
I should much prefer to communicate with you alone I rose to go but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair It is both or none said
he You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html The Count shrugged his broad shoulders Then I must begin said he by binding you both to absolute
secrecy for two years at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history
I promise said Holmes
And I You will excuse this mask continued our strange visitor The august person who employs me wishes his
agent to be unknown to you and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own
I was aware of it said Holmes dryly
The circumstances are of great delicacy and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe To speak plainly the
matter implicates the great House of Ormstein hereditary kings of Bohemia I was also aware of that murmured Holmes settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes
Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe Holmes slowly reopened
his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client
If your Majesty would condescend to state your case he remarked I should be better able to advise you The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation Then with a
gesture of desperation he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground You are right he cried I am the King Why should I attempt to conceal it
Why indeed murmured Holmes Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein Grand Duke of Cassel Felstein and hereditary King of Bohemia
But you can understand said our strange visitor sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person Yet the
matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you
Then pray consult said Holmes shutting his eyes once more
The facts are briefly these Some five years ago during a lengthy visit to Warsaw I made the acquaintance of the well known adventuress Irene Adler The name is no doubt familiar to you
Kindly look her up in my index Doctor murmured Holmes without opening his eyes For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things so that it was difficult to name a
subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff commander who had written a monograph
upon the deep sea fishes
Let me see said Holmes Hum Born in New Jersey in the year Contralto hum La Scala hum
Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw yes Retired from operatic stage ha Living in London quite so
Your Majesty as I understand became entangled with this young person wrote her some compromising letters and is now desirous of getting those letters back
Precisely so But how Was there a secret marriage
None No legal papers or certificates
None Then I fail to follow your Majesty If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other
purposes how is she to prove their authenticity There is the writing
Pooh pooh Forgery My private note paper
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Stolen My own seal
Imitated My photograph
Bought We were both in the photograph
Oh dear That is very bad Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion I was mad insane
You have compromised yourself seriously I was only Crown Prince then I was young I am but thirty now
It must be recovered We have tried and failed
Your Majesty must pay It must be bought She will not sell
Stolen then Five attempts have been made Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house Once we diverted her luggage
when she travelled Twice she has been waylaid There has been no result No sign of it
Absolutely none Holmes laughed It is quite a pretty little problem said he
But a very serious one to me returned the King reproachfully
Very indeed And what does she propose to do with the photograph To ruin me
But how I am about to be married
So I have heard To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe Meningen second daughter of the King of Scandinavia You may know the
strict principles of her family She is herself the very soul of delicacy A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end
And Irene Adler Threatens to send them the photograph And she will do it I know that she will do it You do not know her
but she has a soul of steel She has the face of the most beautiful of women and the mind of the most resolute of men Rather than I should marry another woman there are no lengths to which she would not go none
You are sure that she has not sent it yet I am sure
And why Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed That will
be next Monday Oh then we have three days yet said Holmes with a yawn That is very fortunate as I have one or two
matters of importance to look into just at present Your Majesty will of course stay in London for the present Certainly You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm
Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress Pray do so I shall be all anxiety
Then as to money You have carte blanche
Absolutely PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph
And for present expenses The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table
There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes he said
Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note book and handed it to him
And Mademoiselle s address he asked
Is Briony Lodge Serpentine Avenue St John s Wood Holmes took a note of it One other question said he Was the photograph a cabinet
It was Then good night your Majesty and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you And good
night Watson he added as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street If you will be good enough to call to morrow afternoon at three o clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you
At three o clock precisely I was at Baker Street but Holmes had not yet returned The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o clock in the morning I sat down beside the fire however with the
intention of awaiting him however long he might be I was already deeply interested in his inquiry for though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I
have already recorded still the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own Indeed apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand there was something in his
masterly grasp of a situation and his keen incisive reasoning which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work and to follow the quick subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable
mysteries So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head
It was close upon four before the door opened and a drunken looking groom ill kempt and side whiskered with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes walked into the room Accustomed as I was to my friend s
amazing powers in the use of disguises I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he With a nod he vanished into the bedroom whence he emerged in five minutes tweed suited and respectable as of old
Putting his hands into his pockets he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes
Well really he cried and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back limp and helpless in the chair
What is it It s quite too funny I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning or what I ended by
doing I can t imagine I suppose that you have been watching the habits and perhaps the house of Miss Irene
Adler Quite so but the sequel was rather unusual I will tell you however I left the house a little after eight o clock
this morning in the character of a groom out of work There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men Be one of them and you will know all that there is to know I soon found Briony Lodge It is a bijou
villa with a garden at the back but built out in front right up to the road two stories Chubb lock to the door
Large sitting room on the right side well furnished with long windows almost to the floor and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open Behind there was nothing remarkable save
that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach house I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view but without noting anything else of interest
I then lounged down the street and found as I expected that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses and received in exchange
twopence a glass of half and half two fills of shag tobacco and as much information as I could desire about PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Miss Adler to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least
interested but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to And what of Irene Adler I asked
Oh she has turned all the men s heads down in that part She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet So say the Serpentine mews to a man She lives quietly sings at concerts drives out at five every day
and returns at seven sharp for dinner Seldom goes out at other times except when she sings Has only one male visitor but a good deal of him He is dark handsome and dashing never calls less than once a day and often
twice He is a Mr Godfrey Norton of the Inner Temple See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine mews and knew all about him When I had listened to all
they had to tell I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more and to think over my plan of campaign
This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter He was a lawyer That sounded ominous What was the relation between them and what the object of his repeated visits Was she his client his
friend or his mistress If the former she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping If the latter it was less likely On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge or
turn my attention to the gentleman s chambers in the Temple It was a delicate point and it widened the field of my inquiry I fear that I bore you with these details but I have to let you see my little difficulties if you are to
understand the situation I am following you closely I answered
I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge and a gentleman sprang out He was a remarkably handsome man dark aquiline and moustached evidently the man of whom I
had heard He appeared to be in a great hurry shouted to the cabman to wait and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home
He was in the house about half an hour and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sittingroom pacing up and down talking excitedly and waving his arms Of her I could see nothing Presently he emerged looking even more flurried than before As he stepped up to the cab he pulled a gold watch from his
pocket and looked at it earnestly Drive like the devil he shouted first to Gross Hankey s in Regent Street and then to the Church of St Monica in the Edgeware Road Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes
Away they went and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau the coachman with his coat only half buttoned and his tie under his ear while all the
tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles It hadn t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment but she was a lovely woman with a face that a man might
The Church of St Monica John she cried and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes This was quite too good to lose Watson I was just balancing whether I should run for it or whether I should
perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare but I jumped in before he could object The Church of St Monica said I and half a sovereign if you reach it in
twenty minutes It was twenty five minutes to twelve and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind
My cabby drove fast I don t think I ever drove faster but the others were there before us The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived I paid the man and hurried into the
church There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman who seemed to be expostulating with them They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar I lounged up the side aisle
like any other idler who has dropped into a church Suddenly to my surprise the three at the altar faced round to me and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me
Thank God he cried You ll do Come Come What then I asked
Come man come only three minutes or it won t be legal I was half dragged up to the altar and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which
were whispered in my ear and vouching for things of which I knew nothing and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler spinster to Godfrey Norton bachelor It was all done in an instant and there was the
gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other while the clergyman beamed on me in front It PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life and it was the thought of it that
started me laughing just now It seems that there had been some informality about their license that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort and that my lucky appearance saved
the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man The bride gave me a sovereign and I mean to wear it on my watch chain in memory of the occasion
This is a very unexpected turn of affairs said I and what then Well I found my plans very seriously menaced It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure
and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part At the church door however they separated he driving back to the Temple and she to her own house I shall drive out in the park at five as usual she said
as she left him I heard no more They drove away in different directions and I went off to make my own arrangements
Which are Some cold beef and a glass of beer he answered ringing the bell I have been too busy to think of food
and I am likely to be busier still this evening By the way Doctor I shall want your co operation I shall be delighted
You don t mind breaking the law Not in the least
Nor running a chance of arrest Not in a good cause
Oh the cause is excellent Then I am your man
I was sure that I might rely on you But what is it you wish
When Mrs Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you Now he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided I must discuss it while I eat for I have not much time It is
nearly five now In two hours we must be on the scene of action Miss Irene or Madame rather returns from her drive at seven We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her
And what then You must leave that to me I have already arranged what is to occur There is only one point on which I must
insist You must not interfere come what may You understand I am to be neutral
To do nothing whatever There will probably be some small unpleasantness Do not join in it It will end in my being conveyed into the house Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting room window will open You are
to station yourself close to that open window Yes
You are to watch me for I will be visible to you Yes
And when I raise my hand so you will throw into the room what I give you to throw and will at the same time raise the cry of fire You quite follow me
Entirely It is nothing very formidable he said taking a long cigar shaped roll from his pocket It is an ordinary
plumber s smoke rocket fitted with a cap at either end to make it self lighting Your task is confined to that
When you raise your cry of fire it will be taken up by quite a number of people You may then walk to the end of the street and I will rejoin you in ten minutes I hope that I have made myself clear
I am to remain neutral to get near the window to watch you and at the signal to throw in this object then to raise the cry of fire and to wait you at the corner of the street
Precisely Then you may entirely rely on me

That is excellent I think perhaps it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple
minded Nonconformist clergyman His broad black hat his baggy trousers his white tie his sympathetic smile and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr John Hare alone could have equalled It
was not merely that Holmes changed his costume His expression his manner his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed The stage lost a fine actor even as science lost an acute reasoner when he
became a specialist in crime
It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue It was already dusk and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and
down in front of Briony Lodge waiting for the coming of its occupant The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes succinct description but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected On the
contrary for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood it was remarkably animated There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner a scissors grinder with his wheel two guardsmen who were
flirting with a nurse girl and several well dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths
You see remarked Holmes as we paced to and fro in front of the house this marriage rather simplifies matters The photograph becomes a double edged weapon now The chances are that she would be as averse to
its being seen by Mr Godfrey Norton as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess Now the question is Where are we to find the photograph
Where indeed It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her It is cabinet size Too large for easy concealment about a
woman s dress She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched Two attempts of the sort have already been made We may take it then that she does not carry it about with her
Where then Her banker or her lawyer There is that double possibility But I am inclined to think neither Women are
naturally secretive and they like to do their own secreting Why should she hand it over to anyone else She could trust her own guardianship but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to
bear upon a business man Besides remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days It must be where she can lay her hands upon it It must be in her own house
But it has twice been burgled Pshaw They did not know how to look
But how will you look I will not look
What then I will get her to show me
But she will refuse She will not be able to But I hear the rumble of wheels It is her carriage Now carry out my orders to the
letter As he spoke the gleam of the sidelights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue It was a smart little
landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge As it pulled up one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper but was elbowed away by another loafer who had
rushed up with the same intention A fierce quarrel broke out which was increased by the two guardsmen who took sides with one of the loungers and by the scissors grinder who was equally hot upon the other side A blow
was struck and in an instant the lady who had stepped from her carriage was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks Holmes dashed into the
crowd to protect the lady but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground with the blood running freely down his face At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in
the other while a number of better dressed people who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man Irene Adler as I will still call her had hurried up

the steps but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall looking back into the street
Is the poor gentleman much hurt she asked
He is dead cried several voices
No no there s life in him shouted another But he ll be gone before you can get him to hospital He s a brave fellow said a woman They would have had the lady s purse and watch if it hadn t been for
him They were a gang and a rough one too Ah he s breathing now He can t lie in the street May we bring him in marm
Surely Bring him into the sitting room There is a comfortable sofa This way please Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room while I still observed
the proceedings from my post by the window The lamps had been lit but the blinds had not been drawn so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that
moment for the part he was playing but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring or the grace and kindliness with which she
waited upon the injured man And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me I hardened my heart and took the smoke rocket from under my ulster After
all I thought we are not injuring her We are but preventing her from injuring another
Holmes had sat up upon the couch and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air A maid rushed across and threw open the window At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my
rocket into the room with a cry of Fire The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators well dressed and ill gentlemen ostlers and servant maids joined in a general shriek of Fire
Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window I caught a glimpse of rushing figures and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm Slipping
through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend s arm in mine and to get away from the scene of uproar He walked swiftly and in silence for some few
minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road
You did it very nicely Doctor he remarked Nothing could have been better It is all right You have the photograph
I know where it is And how did you find out
She showed me as I told you she would I am still in the dark
I do not wish to make a mystery said he laughing The matter was perfectly simple You of course saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice They were all engaged for the evening
I guessed as much Then when the row broke out I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand I rushed forward fell
down clapped my hand to my face and became a piteous spectacle It is an old trick That also I could fathom
Then they carried me in She was bound to have me in What else could she do And into her sitting room which was the very room which I suspected It lay between that and her bedroom and I was determined to see
which They laid me on a couch I motioned for air they were compelled to open the window and you had your chance
How did that help you It was all important When a woman thinks that her house is on fire her instinct is at once to rush to the thing
which she values most It is a perfectly overpowering impulse and I have more than once taken advantage of it
In the case of the Darlington Substitution Scandal it was of use to me and also in the Arnsworth Castle business
A married woman grabs at her baby an unmarried one reaches for her jewel box Now it was clear to me that our lady of to day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of She would rush to
secure it The alarm of fire was admirably done The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
She responded beautifully The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell pull She was there in an instant and I caught a glimpse of it as she half drew it out When I cried out that it was a false
alarm she replaced it glanced at the rocket rushed from the room and I have not seen her since I rose and making my excuses escaped from the house I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once but
the coachman had come in and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait A little overprecipitance may ruin all And now I asked
Our quest is practically finished I shall call with the King to morrow and with you if you care to come with us We will be shown into the sitting room to wait for the lady but it is probable that when she comes she may
find neither us nor the photograph It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands And when will you call
At eight in the morning She will not be up so that we shall have a clear field Besides we must be prompt for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits I must wire to the King without delay
We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said
Good night Mister Sherlock Holmes There were several people on the pavement at the time but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth
in an ulster who had hurried by
I ve heard that voice before said Holmes staring down the dimly lit street Now I wonder who the deuce that could have been
I slept at Baker Street that night and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room
You have really got it he cried grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face
Not yet But you have hopes
I have hopes Then come I am all impatience to be gone
We must have a cab No my brougham is waiting
Then that will simplify matters We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge
Irene Adler is married remarked Holmes
Married When Yesterday
But to whom To an English lawyer named Norton
But she could not love him I am in hopes that she does
And why in hopes Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance If the lady loves her husband she does not
love your Majesty If she does not love your Majesty there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty s plan
It is true And yet Well I wish she had been of my own station What a queen she would have made He relapsed into a moody silence which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue

The door of Briony Lodge was open and an elderly woman stood upon the steps She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham
Mr Sherlock Holmes I believe said she
I am Mr Holmes answered my companion looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze
Indeed My mistress told me that you were likely to call She left this morning with her husband by the train from Charing Cross for the Continent
What Sherlock Holmes staggered back white with chagrin and surprise Do you mean that she has left England
Never to return And the papers asked the King hoarsely All is lost
We shall see He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing room followed by the King and myself The furniture was scattered about in every direction with dismantled shelves and open drawers as if the
lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight Holmes rushed at the bell pull tore back a small sliding shutter and plunging in his hand pulled out a photograph and a letter The photograph was of Irene Adler
herself in evening dress the letter was superscribed to Sherlock Holmes Esq To be left till called for My friend tore it open and we all three read it together It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in
MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES You really did it very well You took me in completely Until after the alarm of fire I had not a suspicion But then when I found how
I had betrayed myself I began to think I had been warned against you months ago I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you And your address
had been given me Yet with all this you made me reveal what you wanted to know Even after I became suspicious I found it hard to think evil of such a dear kind old clergyman
But you know I have been trained as an actress myself Male costume is nothing new to me I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives I sent John the coachman to
watch you ran upstairs got into my walking clothes as I call them and came down just as you departed
Well I followed you to your door and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr Sherlock Holmes Then I rather imprudently wished you
good night and started for the Temple to see my husband
We both thought the best resource was flight when pursued by so formidable an antagonist so you will find the nest empty when you call to morrow As to the
photograph your client may rest in peace I love and am loved by a better man than he
The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged
I keep it only to safeguard myself and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future I leave a photograph which he might
care to possess and I remain dear Mr Sherlock Holmes Very truly yours
IRENE NORTON n e ADLER What a woman oh what a woman cried the King of Bohemia when we had all three read this epistle
Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was Would she not have made an admirable queen Is it not a pity that she was not on my level
From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty said Holmes coldly I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty s business to a more successful
conclusion On the contrary my dear sir cried the King nothing could be more successful I know that her word is
inviolate The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire I am glad to hear your Majesty say so
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I am immensely indebted to you Pray tell me in what way I can reward you This ring He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand
Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly said Holmes
You have but to name it This photograph
The King stared at him in amazement
Irene s photograph he cried Certainly if you wish it I thank your Majesty Then there is no more to be done in the matter I have the honour to wish you a very
good morning He bowed and turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him he set off in my company for his chambers
And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia and how the best plans of Mr
Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman s wit He used to make merry over the cleverness of women but I have not heard him do it of late And when he speaks of Irene Adler or when he refers to her photograph it is
always under the honourable title of the woman

THE RED HEADED LEAGUE I had called upon my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep
conversation with a very stout florid faced elderly gentleman with fiery red hair With an apology for my intrusion I was about to withdraw when Holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind
You could not possibly have come at a better time my dear Watson he said cordially
I was afraid that you were engaged So I am Very much so
Then I can wait in the next room Not at all This gentleman Mr Wilson has been my partner and helper in many of my most successful cases
and I have no doubt that he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of greeting with a quick little questioning glance
from his small fat encircled eyes
Try the settee said Holmes relapsing into his armchair and putting his fingertips together as was his custom when in judicial moods I know my dear Watson that you share my love of all that is bizarre and
outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle and if you will excuse my saying so somewhat to embellish
so many of my own little adventures Your cases have indeed been of the greatest interest to me I observed
You will remember that I remarked the other day just before we went into the very simple problem presented by Miss Mary Sutherland that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself which
is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination A proposition which I took the liberty of doubting
You did Doctor but none the less you must come round to my view for otherwise I shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right Now Mr Jabez
Wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which I have listened to for some time You have heard me remark that the strangest and
most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes and occasionally indeed where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed As far as I have heard it
is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an instance of crime or not but the course of events is certainly among the most singular that I have ever listened to Perhaps Mr Wilson you would have the great
kindness to recommence your narrative I ask you not merely because my friend Dr Watson has not heard the opening part but also because the peculiar nature of the story makes me anxious to have every possible detail
from your lips As a rule when I have heard some slight indication of the course of events I am able to guide myself by the thousands of other similar cases which occur to my memory In the present instance I am forced to
admit that the facts are to the best of my belief unique The portly client puffed out his chest with an appearance of some little pride and pulled a dirty and wrinkled
newspaper from the inside pocket of his greatcoat As he glanced down the advertisement column with his head thrust forward and the paper flattened out upon his knee I took a good look at the man and endeavoured after
the fashion of my companion to read the indications which might be presented by his dress or appearance
I did not gain very much however by my inspection Our visitor bore every mark of being an average commonplace British tradesman obese pompous and slow He wore rather baggy grey shepherd s check
trousers a not over clean black frock coat unbuttoned in the front and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Albert chain and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament A frayed top hat and a faded
brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him Altogether look as I would there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head and the expression of extreme chagrin and
discontent upon his features
Sherlock Holmes quick eye took in my occupation and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour that he takes snuff
that he is a Freemason that he has been in China and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately I can deduce nothing else
Mr Jabez Wilson started up in his chair with his forefinger upon the paper but his eyes upon my companion
How in the name of good fortune did you know all that Mr Holmes he asked How did you know for example that I did manual labour It s as true as gospel for I began as a ship s carpenter
Your hands my dear sir Your right hand is quite a size larger than your left You have worked with it and the muscles are more developed
Well the snuff then and the Freemasonry I won t insult your intelligence by telling you how I read that especially as rather against the strict rules of
your order you use an arc and compass breastpin Ah of course I forgot that But the writing
What else can be indicated by that right cuff so very shiny for five inches and the left one with the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk
Well but China The fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in China I
have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject That trick of staining the fishes scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to China When in addition I see a Chinese coin
hanging from your watch chain the matter becomes even more simple Mr Jabez Wilson laughed heavily Well I never said he I thought at first that you had done something
clever but I see that there was nothing in it after all I begin to think Watson said Holmes that I make a mistake in explaining Omne ignotum pro magnifico
you know and my poor little reputation such as it is will suffer shipwreck if I am so candid Can you not find the advertisement Mr Wilson
Yes I have got it now he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column Here it is
This is what began it all You just read it for yourself sir I took the paper from him and read as follows
TO THE RED HEADED LEAGUE On account of the bequest of the late Ezekiah Hopkins of Lebanon Pennsylvania U S A there is now another vacancy open which
entitles a member of the League to a salary of a week for purely nominal services All red headed men who are sound in body and mind and above the age of twenty one years
are eligible Apply in person on Monday at eleven o clock to Duncan Ross at the offices of the League Pope s Court Fleet Street
What on earth does this mean I ejaculated after I had twice read over the extraordinary announcement
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair as was his habit when in high spirits It is a little off the beaten track isn t it said he And now Mr Wilson off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself your
household and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes You will first make a note Doctor of the paper and the date
It is The Morning Chronicle of April Just two months ago Very good Now Mr Wilson
Well it is just as I have been telling you Mr Sherlock Holmes said Jabez Wilson mopping his forehead I have a small pawnbroker s business at Coburg Square near the City It s not a very large affair and of late years
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
it has not done more than just give me a living I used to be able to keep two assistants but now I only keep one
and I would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business What is the name of this obliging youth asked Sherlock Holmes
His name is Vincent Spaulding and he s not such a youth either It s hard to say his age I should not wish a smarter assistant Mr Holmes and I know very well that he could better himself and earn twice what I am able
to give him But after all if he is satisfied why should I put ideas in his head Why indeed You seem most fortunate in having an employ who comes under the full market price It is not
a common experience among employers in this age I don t know that your assistant is not as remarkable as your advertisement
Oh he has his faults too said Mr Wilson Never was such a fellow for photography Snapping away with a camera when he ought to be improving his mind and then diving down into the cellar like a rabbit into its hole
to develop his pictures That is his main fault but on the whole he s a good worker There s no vice in him He is still with you I presume
Yes sir He and a girl of fourteen who does a bit of simple cooking and keeps the place clean that s all I have in the house for I am a widower and never had any family We live very quietly sir the three of us and we
keep a roof over our heads and pay our debts if we do nothing more
The first thing that put us out was that advertisement Spaulding he came down into the office just this day eight weeks with this very paper in his hand and he says
I wish to the Lord Mr Wilson that I was a red headed man Why that I asks
Why says he here s another vacancy on the League of the Red headed Men It s worth quite a little fortune to any man who gets it and I understand that there are more vacancies than there are men so that the
trustees are at their wits end what to do with the money If my hair would only change colour here s a nice little crib all ready for me to step into
Why what is it then I asked You see Mr Holmes I am a very stay at home man and as my business came to me instead of my having to go to it I was often weeks on end without putting my foot over the doormat In that way I didn t know much of what was going on outside and I was always glad of a bit of news
Have you never heard of the League of the Red headed Men he asked with his eyes open
Never Why I wonder at that for you are eligible yourself for one of the vacancies
And what are they worth I asked
Oh merely a couple of hundred a year but the work is slight and it need not interfere very much with one s other occupations
Well you can easily think that that made me prick up my ears for the business has not been over good for some years and an extra couple of hundred would have been very handy
Tell me all about it said I
Well said he showing me the advertisement you can see for yourself that the League has a vacancy and there is the address where you should apply for particulars As far as I can make out the League was founded by
an American millionaire Ezekiah Hopkins who was very peculiar in his ways He was himself red headed and he had a great sympathy for all red headed men so when he died it was found that he had left his enormous
fortune in the hands of trustees with instructions to apply the interest to the providing of easy berths to men whose hair is of that colour From all I hear it is splendid pay and very little to do
But said I there would be millions of red headed men who would apply Not so many as you might think he answered You see it is really confined to Londoners and to grown
men This American had started from London when he was young and he wanted to do the old town a good turn
Then again I have heard it is no use your applying if your hair is light red or dark red or anything but real bright blazing fiery red Now if you cared to apply Mr Wilson you would just walk in but perhaps it would
hardly be worth your while to put yourself out of the way for the sake of a few hundred pounds PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Now it is a fact gentlemen as you may see for yourselves that my hair is of a very full and rich tint so that
it seemed to me that if there was to be any competition in the matter I stood as good a chance as any man that I had ever met Vincent Spaulding seemed to know so much about it that I thought he might prove useful so I just
ordered him to put up the shutters for the day and to come right away with me He was very willing to have a holiday so we shut the business up and started off for the address that was given us in the advertisement
I never hope to see such a sight as that again Mr Holmes From north south east and west every man who had a shade of red in his hair had tramped into the city to answer the advertisement Fleet Street was choked with
red headed folk and Pope s Court looked like a coster s orange barrow I should not have thought there were so many in the whole country as were brought together by that single advertisement Every shade of colour they
were straw lemon orange brick Irish setter liver clay but as Spaulding said there were not many who had the real vivid flame coloured tint When I saw how many were waiting I would have given it up in despair but
Spaulding would not hear of it How he did it I could not imagine but he pushed and pulled and butted until he got me through the crowd and right up to the steps which led to the office There was a double stream upon the
stair some going up in hope and some coming back dejected but we wedged in as well as we could and soon found ourselves in the office
Your experience has been a most entertaining one remarked Holmes as his client paused and refreshed his memory with a huge pinch of snuff Pray continue your very interesting statement
There was nothing in the office but a couple of wooden chairs and a deal table behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine He said a few words to each candidate as he came up and then he
always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them Getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter after all However when our turn came the little man was much more favourable to me
than to any of the others and he closed the door as we entered so that he might have a private word with us
This is Mr Jabez Wilson said my assistant and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the League And he is admirably suited for it the other answered He has every requirement I cannot recall when I
have seen anything so fine He took a step backward cocked his head on one side and gazed at my hair until I felt quite bashful Then suddenly he plunged forward wrung my hand and congratulated me warmly on my
It would be injustice to hesitate said he You will however I am sure excuse me for taking an obvious precaution With that he seized my hair in both his hands and tugged until I yelled with the pain There is water
in your eyes said he as he released me I perceive that all is as it should be But we have to be careful for we have twice been deceived by wigs and once by paint I could tell you tales of cobbler s wax which would disgust
you with human nature He stepped over to the window and shouted through it at the top of his voice that the vacancy was filled A groan of disappointment came up from below and the folk all trooped away in different
directions until there was not a red head to be seen except my own and that of the manager
My name said he is Mr Duncan Ross and I am myself one of the pensioners upon the fund left by our noble benefactor Are you a married man Mr Wilson Have you a family
I answered that I had not
His face fell immediately
Dear me he said gravely that is very serious indeed I am sorry to hear you say that The fund was of course for the propagation and spread of the red heads as well as for their maintenance It is exceedingly
unfortunate that you should be a bachelor My face lengthened at this Mr Holmes for I thought that I was not to have the vacancy after all but after
thinking it over for a few minutes he said that it would be all right
In the case of another said he the objection might be fatal but we must stretch a point in favour of a man with such a head of hair as yours When shall you be able to enter upon your new duties
Well it is a little awkward for I have a business already said I
Oh never mind about that Mr Wilson said Vincent Spaulding I should be able to look after that for you What would be the hours I asked
Ten to two PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Now a pawnbroker s business is mostly done of an evening Mr Holmes especially Thursday and Friday
evening which is just before pay day so it would suit me very well to earn a little in the mornings Besides I knew that my assistant was a good man and that he would see to anything that turned up
That would suit me very well said I And the pay Is a week
And the work Is purely nominal
What do you call purely nominal Well you have to be in the office or at least in the building the whole time If you leave you forfeit your
whole position forever The will is very clear upon that point You don t comply with the conditions if you budge from the office during that time
It s only four hours a day and I should not think of leaving said I
No excuse will avail said Mr Duncan Ross neither sickness nor business nor anything else There you must stay or you lose your billet
And the work Is to copy out the Encyclop dia Britannica There is the first volume of it in that press You must find your
own ink pens and blotting paper but we provide this table and chair Will you be ready to morrow Certainly I answered
Then good bye Mr Jabez Wilson and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain He bowed me out of the room and I went home with my assistant
hardly knowing what to say or do I was so pleased at my own good fortune
Well I thought over the matter all day and by evening I was in low spirits again for I had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud though what its object might be I could not
imagine It seemed altogether past belief that anyone could make such a will or that they would pay such a sum for doing anything so simple as copying out the Encyclop dia Britannica Vincent Spaulding did what he could
to cheer me up but by bedtime I had reasoned myself out of the whole thing However in the morning I determined to have a look at it anyhow so I bought a penny bottle of ink and with a quill pen and seven sheets
of foolscap paper I started off for Pope s Court
Well to my surprise and delight everything was as right as possible The table was set out ready for me and Mr Duncan Ross was there to see that I got fairly to work He started me off upon the letter A and then he left
me but he would drop in from time to time to see that all was right with me At two o clock he bade me goodday complimented me upon the amount that I had written and locked the door of the office after me
This went on day after day Mr Holmes and on Saturday the manager came in and planked down four golden sovereigns for my week s work It was the same next week and the same the week after Every morning I
was there at ten and every afternoon I left at two By degrees Mr Duncan Ross took to coming in only once of a morning and then after a time he did not come in at all Still of course I never dared to leave the room for an
instant for I was not sure when he might come and the billet was such a good one and suited me so well that I would not risk the loss of it
Eight weeks passed away like this and I had written about Abbots and Archery and Armour and Architecture and Attica and hoped with diligence that I might get on to the B s before very long It cost me something in
foolscap and I had pretty nearly filled a shelf with my writings And then suddenly the whole business came to an end
To an end Yes sir And no later than this morning I went to my work as usual at ten o clock but the door was shut and
locked with a little square of cardboard hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack Here it is and you can read for yourself
He held up a piece of white cardboard about the size of a sheet of note paper It read in this fashion
THE RED HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED October PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Sherlock Holmes and I surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it until the comical side of
the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter
I cannot see that there is anything very funny cried our client flushing up to the roots of his flaming head
If you can do nothing better than laugh at me I can go elsewhere No no cried Holmes shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen I really wouldn t miss
your case for the world It is most refreshingly unusual But there is if you will excuse my saying so something just a little funny about it Pray what steps did you take when you found the card upon the door
I was staggered sir I did not know what to do Then I called at the offices round but none of them seemed to know anything about it Finally I went to the landlord who is an accountant living on the ground floor and I
asked him if he could tell me what had become of the Red headed League He said that he had never heard of any such body Then I asked him who Mr Duncan Ross was He answered that the name was new to him
Well said I the gentleman at No What the red headed man
Yes Oh said he his name was William Morris He was a solicitor and was using my room as a temporary
convenience until his new premises were ready He moved out yesterday Where could I find him
Oh at his new offices He did tell me the address Yes King Edward Street near St Paul s I started off Mr Holmes but when I got to that address it was a manufactory of artificial knee caps and no
one in it had ever heard of either Mr William Morris or Mr Duncan Ross And what did you do then asked Holmes
I went home to Saxe Coburg Square and I took the advice of my assistant But he could not help me in any way He could only say that if I waited I should hear by post But that was not quite good enough Mr Holmes I
did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle so as I had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it I came right away to you
And you did very wisely said Holmes Your case is an exceedingly remarkable one and I shall be happy to look into it From what you have told me I think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at
first sight appear Grave enough said Mr Jabez Wilson Why I have lost four pound a week
As far as you are personally concerned remarked Holmes I do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league On the contrary you are as I understand richer by some to say nothing of the
minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter A You have lost nothing by them
No sir But I want to find out about them and who they are and what their object was in playing this prank if it was a prank upon me It was a pretty expensive joke for them for it cost them two and thirty pounds
We shall endeavour to clear up these points for you And first one or two questions Mr Wilson This assistant of yours who first called your attention to the advertisement how long had he been with you
About a month then How did he come
In answer to an advertisement Was he the only applicant
No I had a dozen Why did you pick him
Because he was handy and would come cheap At half wages in fact
Yes What is he like this Vincent Spaulding
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Small stout built very quick in his ways no hair on his face though he s not short of thirty Has a white splash of acid upon his forehead
Holmes sat up in his chair in considerable excitement I thought as much said he Have you ever observed that his ears are pierced for earrings
Yes sir He told me that a gipsy had done it for him when he was a lad Hum said Holmes sinking back in deep thought He is still with you
Oh yes sir I have only just left him And has your business been attended to in your absence
Nothing to complain of sir There s never very much to do of a morning That will do Mr Wilson I shall be happy to give you an opinion upon the subject in the course of a day or
two To day is Saturday and I hope that by Monday we may come to a conclusion Well Watson said Holmes when our visitor had left us what do you make of it all
I make nothing of it I answered frankly It is a most mysterious business As a rule said Holmes the more bizarre a thing is the less mysterious it proves to be It is your
commonplace featureless crimes which are really puzzling just as a commonplace face is the most difficult to identify But I must be prompt over this matter
What are you going to do then I asked
To smoke he answered It is quite a three pipe problem and I beg that you won t speak to me for fifty minutes He curled himself up in his chair with his thin knees drawn up to his hawk like nose and there he sat
with his eyes closed and his black clay pipe thrusting out like the bill of some strange bird I had come to the conclusion that he had dropped asleep and indeed was nodding myself when he suddenly sprang out of his
chair with the gesture of a man who has made up his mind and put his pipe down upon the mantelpiece
Sarasate plays at the St James s Hall this afternoon he remarked What do you think Watson Could your patients spare you for a few hours
I have nothing to do to day My practice is never very absorbing Then put on your hat and come I am going through the City first and we can have some lunch on the way I
observe that there is a good deal of German music on the programme which is rather more to my taste than Italian or French It is introspective and I want to introspect Come along
We travelled by the Underground as far as Aldersgate and a short walk took us to Saxe Coburg Square the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning It was a poky little shabby genteel place
where four lines of dingy two storied brick houses looked out into a small railed in enclosure where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel bushes made a hard fight against a smoke laden and uncongenial
atmosphere Three gilt balls and a brown board with JABEZ WILSON in white letters upon a corner house announced the place where our red headed client carried on his business Sherlock Holmes stopped in front of it
with his head on one side and looked it all over with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids Then he walked slowly up the street and then down again to the corner still looking keenly at the houses Finally he
returned to the pawnbroker s and having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times he went up to the door and knocked It was instantly opened by a bright looking clean shaven young
fellow who asked him to step in
Thank you said Holmes I only wished to ask you how you would go from here to the Strand Third right fourth left answered the assistant promptly closing the door
Smart fellow that observed Holmes as we walked away He is in my judgment the fourth smartest man in London and for daring I am not sure that he has not a claim to be third I have known something of him before
Evidently said I Mr Wilson s assistant counts for a good deal in this mystery of the Red headed League I am sure that you inquired your way merely in order that you might see him
Not him What then
The knees of his trousers And what did you see
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
What I expected to see Why did you beat the pavement
My dear doctor this is a time for observation not for talk We are spies in an enemy s country We know something of Saxe Coburg Square Let us now explore the parts which lie behind it
The road in which we found ourselves as we turned round the corner from the retired Saxe Coburg Square presented as great a contrast to it as the front of a picture does to the back It was one of the main arteries which
conveyed the traffic of the City to the north and west The roadway was blocked with the immense stream of commerce flowing in a double tide inward and outward while the footpaths were black with the hurrying swarm
of pedestrians It was difficult to realise as we looked at the line of fine shops and stately business premises that they really abutted on the other side upon the faded and stagnant square which we had just quitted
Let me see said Holmes standing at the corner and glancing along the line I should like just to remember the order of the houses here It is a hobby of mine to have an exact knowledge of London There is Mortimer s
the tobacconist the little newspaper shop the Coburg branch of the City and Suburban Bank the Vegetarian Restaurant and Mc Farlane s carriage building depot That carries us right on to the other block And now
Doctor we ve done our work so it s time we had some play A sandwich and a cup of coffee and then off to violin land where all is sweetness and delicacy and harmony and there are no red headed clients to vex us with
their conundrums My friend was an enthusiastic musician being himself not only a very capable performer but a composer of
no ordinary merit All the afternoon he sat in the stalls wrapped in the most perfect happiness gently waving his long thin fingers in time to the music while his gently smiling face and his languid dreamy eyes were as unlike
those of Holmes the sleuth hound Holmes the relentless keen witted ready handed criminal agent as it was possible to conceive In his singular character the dual nature alternately asserted itself and his extreme
exactness and astuteness represented as I have often thought the reaction against the poetic and contemplative mood which occasionally predominated in him The swing of his nature took him from extreme languor to
devouring energy and as I knew well he was never so truly formidable as when for days on end he had been lounging in his armchair amid his improvisations and his black letter editions Then it was that the lust of the
chase would suddenly come upon him and that his brilliant reasoning power would rise to the level of intuition until those who were unacquainted with his methods would look askance at him as on a man whose knowledge
was not that of other mortals When I saw him that afternoon so enwrapped in the music at St James s Hall I felt that an evil time might be coming upon those whom he had set himself to hunt down
You want to go home no doubt Doctor he remarked as we emerged
Yes it would be as well And I have some business to do which will take some hours This business at Coburg Square is serious
Why serious A considerable crime is in contemplation I have every reason to believe that we shall be in time to stop it
But to day being Saturday rather complicates matters I shall want your help to night At what time
Ten will be early enough I shall be at Baker Street at ten
Very well And I say Doctor there may be some little danger so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket He waved his hand turned on his heel and disappeared in an instant among the crowd
I trust that I am not more dense than my neighbours but I was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with Sherlock Holmes Here I had heard what he had heard I had seen what he had
seen and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque As I drove home to my house in
Kensington I thought over it all from the extraordinary story of the red headed copier of the Encyclop dia down to the visit to Saxe Coburg Square and the ominous words with which he had parted from me What was
this nocturnal expedition and why should I go armed Where were we going and what were we to do I had the hint from Holmes that this smooth faced pawnbroker s assistant was a formidable man a man who might play
a deep game I tried to puzzle it out but gave it up in despair and set the matter aside until night should bring an explanation

It was a quarter past nine when I started from home and made my way across the Park and so through Oxford Street to Baker Street Two hansoms were standing at the door and as I entered the passage I heard the sound of
voices from above On entering his room I found Holmes in animated conversation with two men one of whom I recognised as Peter Jones the official police agent while the other was a long thin sad faced man with a very
shiny hat and oppressively respectable frock coat
Ha Our party is complete said Holmes buttoning up his pea jacket and taking his heavy hunting crop from the rack Watson I think you know Mr Jones of Scotland Yard Let me introduce you to Mr Merryweather
who is to be our companion in to night s adventure We re hunting in couples again Doctor you see said Jones in his consequential way Our friend here is a
wonderful man for starting a chase All he wants is an old dog to help him to do the running down I hope a wild goose may not prove to be the end of our chase observed Mr Merryweather gloomily
You may place considerable confidence in Mr Holmes sir said the police agent loftily He has his own little methods which are if he won t mind my saying so just a little too theoretical and fantastic but he has the
makings of a detective in him It is not too much to say that once or twice as in that business of the Sholto murder and the Agra treasure he has been more nearly correct than the official force
Oh if you say so Mr Jones it is all right said the stranger with deference Still I confess that I miss my rubber It is the first Saturday night for seven and twenty years that I have not had my rubber
I think you will find said Sherlock Holmes that you will play for a higher stake to night than you have ever done yet and that the play will be more exciting For you Mr Merryweather the stake will be some
and for you Jones it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands John Clay the murderer thief smasher and forger He s a young man Mr Merryweather but he is at the
head of his profession and I would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in London He s a remarkable man is young John Clay His grandfather was a royal duke and he himself has been to Eton and
Oxford His brain is as cunning as his fingers and though we meet signs of him at every turn we never know where to find the man himself He ll crack a crib in Scotland one week and be raising money to build an
orphanage in Cornwall the next I ve been on his track for years and have never set eyes on him yet I hope that I may have the pleasure of introducing you to night I ve had one or two little turns also with Mr
John Clay and I agree with you that he is at the head of his profession It is past ten however and quite time that we started If you two will take the first hansom Watson and I will follow in the second
Sherlock Holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon We rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas lit streets until we
emerged into Farrington Street
We are close there now my friend remarked This fellow Merryweather is a bank director and personally interested in the matter I thought it as well to have Jones with us also He is not a bad fellow though an absolute
imbecile in his profession He has one positive virtue He is as brave as a bulldog and as tenacious as a lobster if he gets his claws upon anyone Here we are and they are waiting for us
We had reached the same crowded thoroughfare in which we had found ourselves in the morning Our cabs were dismissed and following the guidance of Mr Merryweather we passed down a narrow passage and
through a side door which he opened for us Within there was a small corridor which ended in a very massive iron gate This also was opened and led down a flight of winding stone steps which terminated at another
formidable gate Mr Merryweather stopped to light a lantern and then conducted us down a dark earth smelling passage and so after opening a third door into a huge vault or cellar which was piled all round with crates and
You are not very vulnerable from above Holmes remarked as he held up the lantern and gazed about him
Nor from below said Mr Merryweather striking his stick upon the flags which lined the floor Why dear me it sounds quite hollow he remarked looking up in surprise
I must really ask you to be a little more quiet said Holmes severely You have already imperilled the whole success of our expedition Might I beg that you would have the goodness to sit down upon one of those
boxes and not to interfere The solemn Mr Merryweather perched himself upon a crate with a very injured expression upon his face
while Holmes fell upon his knees upon the floor and with the lantern and a magnifying lens began to examine PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html minutely the cracks between the stones A few seconds sufficed to satisfy him for he sprang to his feet again and
put his glass in his pocket
We have at least an hour before us he remarked for they can hardly take any steps until the good pawnbroker is safely in bed Then they will not lose a minute for the sooner they do their work the longer time
they will have for their escape We are at present Doctor as no doubt you have divined in the cellar of the City branch of one of the principal London banks Mr Merryweather is the chairman of directors and he will
explain to you that there are reasons why the more daring criminals of London should take a considerable interest in this cellar at present
It is our French gold whispered the director We have had several warnings that an attempt might be made upon it
Your French gold Yes We had occasion some months ago to strengthen our resources and borrowed for that purpose
napoleons from the Bank of France It has become known that we have never had occasion to unpack the money and that it is still lying in our cellar The crate upon which I sit contains napoleons packed between layers
of lead foil Our reserve of bullion is much larger at present than is usually kept in a single branch office and the directors have had misgivings upon the subject
Which were very well justified observed Holmes And now it is time that we arranged our little plans I expect that within an hour matters will come to a head In the meantime Mr Merryweather we must put the
screen over that dark lantern And sit in the dark
I am afraid so I had brought a pack of cards in my pocket and I thought that as we were a partie carr e you might have your rubber after all But I see that the enemy s preparations have gone so far that we cannot risk
the presence of a light And first of all we must choose our positions These are daring men and though we shall take them at a disadvantage they may do us some harm unless we are careful I shall stand behind this
crate and do you conceal yourselves behind those Then when I flash a light upon them close in swiftly If they fire Watson have no compunction about shooting them down
I placed my revolver cocked upon the top of the wooden case behind which I crouched Holmes shot the slide across the front of his lantern and left us in pitch darkness such an absolute darkness as I have never
before experienced The smell of hot metal remained to assure us that the light was still there ready to flash out at a moment s notice To me with my nerves worked up to a pitch of expectancy there was something
depressing and subduing in the sudden gloom and in the cold dank air of the vault
They have but one retreat whispered Holmes That is back through the house into Saxe Coburg Square I hope that you have done what I asked you Jones
I have an inspector and two officers waiting at the front door Then we have stopped all the holes And now we must be silent and wait
What a time it seemed From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us My limbs were weary and stiff for
I feared to change my position yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions but I could distinguish the
deeper heavier in breath of the bulky Jones from the thin sighing note of the bank director From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor Suddenly my eyes caught the glint of a light
At first it was but a lurid spark upon the stone pavement Then it lengthened out until it became a yellow line and then without any warning or sound a gash seemed to open and a hand appeared a white almost womanly
hand which felt about in the centre of the little area of light For a minute or more the hand with its writhing fingers protruded out of the floor Then it was withdrawn as suddenly as it appeared and all was dark again save
the single lurid spark which marked a chink between the stones
Its disappearance however was but momentary With a rending tearing sound one of the broad white stones turned over upon its side and left a square gaping hole through which streamed the light of a lantern Over the
edge there peeped a clean cut boyish face which looked keenly about it and then with a hand on either side of the aperture drew itself shoulder high and waist high until one knee rested upon the edge In another instant he
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion lithe and small like himself with a pale face and a shock of very red hair
It s all clear he whispered Have you the chisel and the bags Great Scott Jump Archie jump and I ll swing for it
Sherlock Holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar The other dived down the hole and I heard the sound of rending cloth as Jones clutched at his skirts The light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver
but Holmes hunting crop came down on the man s wrist and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor
It s no use John Clay said Holmes blandly You have no chance at all So I see the other answered with the utmost coolness I fancy that my pal is all right though I see you
have got his coat tails There are three men waiting for him at the door said Holmes
Oh indeed You seem to have done the thing very completely I must compliment you And I you Holmes answered Your red headed idea was very new and effective
You ll see your pal again presently said Jones He s quicker at climbing down holes than I am Just hold out while I fix the derbies
I beg that you will not touch me with your filthy hands remarked our prisoner as the handcuffs clattered upon his wrists You may not be aware that I have royal blood in my veins Have the goodness also when you
address me always to say sir and please All right said Jones with a stare and a snigger Well would you please sir march upstairs where we can
get a cab to carry your Highness to the police station That is better said John Clay serenely He made a sweeping bow to the three of us and walked quietly off in
the custody of the detective
Really Mr Holmes said Mr Merryweather as we followed them from the cellar I do not know how the bank can thank you or repay you There is no doubt that you have detected and defeated in the most complete
manner one of the most determined attempts at bank robbery that have ever come within my experience I have had one or two little scores of my own to settle with Mr John Clay said Holmes I have been at
some small expense over this matter which I shall expect the bank to refund but beyond that I am amply repaid by having had an experience which is in many ways unique and by hearing the very remarkable narrative of the
Red headed League You see Watson he explained in the early hours of the morning as we sat over a glass of whisky and soda
in Baker Street it was perfectly obvious from the first that the only possible object of this rather fantastic business of the advertisement of the League and the copying of the Encyclop dia must be to get this not overbright pawnbroker out of the way for a number of hours every day It was a curious way of managing it but
really it would be difficult to suggest a better The method was no doubt suggested to Clay s ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice s hair The a week was a lure which must draw him and what was it to them
who were playing for thousands They put in the advertisement one rogue has the temporary office the other rogue incites the man to apply for it and together they manage to secure his absence every morning in the week
From the time that I heard of the assistant having come for half wages it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive for securing the situation
But how could you guess what the motive was Had there been women in the house I should have suspected a mere vulgar intrigue That however was out
of the question The man s business was a small one and there was nothing in his house which could account for such elaborate preparations and such an expenditure as they were at It must then be something out of the
house What could it be I thought of the assistant s fondness for photography and his trick of vanishing into the cellar The cellar There was the end of this tangled clue Then I made inquiries as to this mysterious assistant
and found that I had to deal with one of the coolest and most daring criminals in London He was doing something in the cellar something which took many hours a day for months on end What could it be once
more I could think of nothing save that he was running a tunnel to some other building
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
So far I had got when we went to visit the scene of action I surprised you by beating upon the pavement with my stick I was ascertaining whether the cellar stretched out in front or behind It was not in front Then I rang
the bell and as I hoped the assistant answered it We have had some skirmishes but we had never set eyes upon each other before I hardly looked at his face His knees were what I wished to see You must yourself have
remarked how worn wrinkled and stained they were They spoke of those hours of burrowing The only remaining point was what they were burrowing for I walked round the corner saw the City and Suburban Bank
abutted on our friend s premises and felt that I had solved my problem When you drove home after the concert I called upon Scotland Yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors with the result that you have seen
And how could you tell that they would make their attempt to night I asked
Well when they closed their League offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about Mr Jabez Wilson s presence in other words that they had completed their tunnel But it was essential that they should
use it soon as it might be discovered or the bullion might be removed Saturday would suit them better than any other day as it would give them two days for their escape For all these reasons I expected them to come tonight
You reasoned it out beautifully I exclaimed in unfeigned admiration It is so long a chain and yet every link rings true
It saved me from ennui he answered yawning Alas I already feel it closing in upon me My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence These little problems help me to do so
And you are a benefactor of the race said I
He shrugged his shoulders Well perhaps after all it is of some little use he remarked L homme c est rien l uvre c est tout as Gustave Flaubert wrote to George Sand
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
A CASE OF IDENTITY My dear fellow said Sherlock Holmes as we sat on either side of the fire in his lodgings at Baker Street
life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence If we could fly out of that window hand in hand hover
over this great city gently remove the roofs and peep in at the queer things which are going on the strange coincidences the plannings the cross purposes the wonderful chains of events working through generations
and leading to the most outr results it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable
And yet I am not convinced of it I answered The cases which come to light in the papers are as a rule bald enough and vulgar enough We have in our police reports realism pushed to its extreme limits and yet the
result is it must be confessed neither fascinating nor artistic A certain selection and discretion must be used in producing a realistic effect remarked Holmes This is
wanting in the police report where more stress is laid perhaps upon the platitudes of the magistrate than upon the details which to an observer contain the vital essence of the whole matter Depend upon it there is nothing
so unnatural as the commonplace I smiled and shook my head I can quite understand your thinking so I said Of course in your position of
unofficial adviser and helper to everybody who is absolutely puzzled throughout three continents you are brought in contact with all that is strange and bizarre But here I picked up the morning paper from the ground
let us put it to a practical test Here is the first heading upon which I come A husband s cruelty to his wife There is half a column of print but I know without reading it that it is all perfectly familiar to me There is of
course the other woman the drink the push the blow the bruise the sympathetic sister or landlady The crudest of writers could invent nothing more crude
Indeed your example is an unfortunate one for your argument said Holmes taking the paper and glancing his eye down it This is the Dundas separation case and as it happens I was engaged in clearing up some small
points in connection with it The husband was a teetotaler there was no other woman and the conduct complained of was that he had drifted into the habit of winding up every meal by taking out his false teeth and
hurling them at his wife which you will allow is not an action likely to occur to the imagination of the average story teller Take a pinch of snuff Doctor and acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example
He held out his snuffbox of old gold with a great amethyst in the centre of the lid Its splendour was in such contrast to his homely ways and simple life that I could not help commenting upon it
Ah said he I forgot that I had not seen you for some weeks It is a little souvenir from the King of Bohemia in return for my assistance in the case of the Irene Adler papers
And the ring I asked glancing at a remarkable brilliant which sparkled upon his finger
It was from the reigning family of Holland though the matter in which I served them was of such delicacy that I cannot confide it even to you who have been good enough to chronicle one or two of my little problems
And have you any on hand just now I asked with interest
Some ten or twelve but none which present any feature of interest They are important you understand without being interesting Indeed I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for
the observation and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler for the bigger the crime the more obvious as a rule is the motive In
these cases save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles there is nothing which presents any features of interest It is possible however that I may have something better before very

https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html He had risen from his chair and was standing between the parted blinds gazing down into the dull neutraltinted London street Looking over his shoulder I saw that on the pavement opposite there stood a large woman
with a heavy fur boa round her neck and a large curling red feather in a broad brimmed hat which was tilted in a coquettish Duchess of Devonshire fashion over her ear From under this great panoply she peeped up in a
nervous hesitating fashion at our windows while her body oscillated backward and forward and her fingers fidgeted with her glove buttons Suddenly with a plunge as of the swimmer who leaves the bank she hurried
across the road and we heard the sharp clang of the bell
I have seen those symptoms before said Holmes throwing his cigarette into the fire Oscillation upon the pavement always means an affaire de c ur She would like advice but is not sure that the matter is not too
delicate for communication And yet even here we may discriminate When a woman has been seriously wronged by a man she no longer oscillates and the usual symptom is a broken bell wire Here we may take it
that there is a love matter but that the maiden is not so much angry as perplexed or grieved But here she comes in person to resolve our doubts
As he spoke there was a tap at the door and the boy in buttons entered to announce Miss Mary Sutherland while the lady herself loomed behind his small black figure like a full sailed merchant man behind a tiny pilot
boat Sherlock Holmes welcomed her with the easy courtesy for which he was remarkable and having closed the door and bowed her into an armchair he looked her over in the minute and yet abstracted fashion which was
Do you not find he said that with your short sight it is a little trying to do so much typewriting I did at first she answered but now I know where the letters are without looking Then suddenly
realising the full purport of his words she gave a violent start and looked up with fear and astonishment upon her broad good humoured face You ve heard about me Mr Holmes she cried else how could you know all
that Never mind said Holmes laughing it is my business to know things Perhaps I have trained myself to see
what others overlook If not why should you come to consult me I came to you sir because I heard of you from Mrs Etherege whose husband you found so easy when the
police and everyone had given him up for dead Oh Mr Holmes I wish you would do as much for me I m not rich but still I have a hundred a year in my own right besides the little that I make by the machine and I would
give it all to know what has become of Mr Hosmer Angel Why did you come away to consult me in such a hurry asked Sherlock Holmes with his finger tips
together and his eyes to the ceiling
Again a startled look came over the somewhat vacuous face of Miss Mary Sutherland Yes I did bang out of the house she said for it made me angry to see the easy way in which Mr Windibank that is my father
took it all He would not go to the police and he would not go to you and so at last as he would do nothing and kept on saying that there was no harm done it made me mad and I just on with my things and came right away
to you Your father said Holmes your stepfather surely since the name is different
Yes my stepfather I call him father though it sounds funny too for he is only five years and two months older than myself
And your mother is alive Oh yes mother is alive and well I wasn t best pleased Mr Holmes when she married again so soon after
father s death and a man who was nearly fifteen years younger than herself Father was a plumber in the Tottenham Court Road and he left a tidy business behind him which mother carried on with Mr Hardy the
foreman but when Mr Windibank came he made her sell the business for he was very superior being a traveller in wines They got for the goodwill and interest which wasn t near as much as father could have got if he
had been alive I had expected to see Sherlock Holmes impatient under this rambling and inconsequential narrative but on
the contrary he had listened with the greatest concentration of attention
Your own little income he asked does it come out of the business Oh no sir It is quite separate and was left me by my uncle Ned in Auckland It is in New Zealand stock
paying per cent Two thousand five hundred pounds was the amount but I can only touch the interest PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html You interest me extremely said Holmes And since you draw so large a sum as a hundred a year with what
you earn into the bargain you no doubt travel a little and indulge yourself in every way I believe that a single lady can get on very nicely upon an income of about
I could do with much less than that Mr Holmes but you understand that as long as I live at home I don t wish to be a burden to them and so they have the use of the money just while I am staying with them Of course
that is only just for the time Mr Windibank draws my interest every quarter and pays it over to mother and I find that I can do pretty well with what I earn at typewriting It brings me twopence a sheet and I can often do
from fifteen to twenty sheets in a day You have made your position very clear to me said Holmes This is my friend Dr Watson before whom
you can speak as freely as before myself Kindly tell us now all about your connection with Mr Hosmer Angel A flush stole over Miss Sutherland s face and she picked nervously at the fringe of her jacket I met him first
at the gasfitters ball she said They used to send father tickets when he was alive and then afterwards they remembered us and sent them to mother Mr Windibank did not wish us to go He never did wish us to go
anywhere He would get quite mad if I wanted so much as to join a Sunday school treat But this time I was set on going and I would go for what right had he to prevent He said the folk were not fit for us to know when all
father s friends were to be there And he said that I had nothing fit to wear when I had my purple plush that I had never so much as taken out of the drawer At last when nothing else would do he went off to France upon
the business of the firm but we went mother and I with Mr Hardy who used to be our foreman and it was there I met Mr Hosmer Angel
I suppose said Holmes that when Mr Windibank came back from France he was very annoyed at your having gone to the ball
Oh well he was very good about it He laughed I remember and shrugged his shoulders and said there was no use denying anything to a woman for she would have her way
I see Then at the gasfitters ball you met as I understand a gentleman called Mr Hosmer Angel Yes sir I met him that night and he called next day to ask if we had got home all safe and after that we met
him that is to say Mr Holmes I met him twice for walks but after that father came back again and Mr
Hosmer Angel could not come to the house any more No
Well you know father didn t like anything of the sort He wouldn t have any visitors if he could help it and he used to say that a woman should be happy in her own family circle But then as I used to say to mother a
woman wants her own circle to begin with and I had not got mine yet But how about Mr Hosmer Angel Did he make no attempt to see you
Well father was going off to France again in a week and Hosmer wrote and said that it would be safer and better not to see each other until he had gone We could write in the meantime and he used to write every day I
took the letters in in the morning so there was no need for father to know Were you engaged to the gentleman at this time
Oh yes Mr Holmes We were engaged after the first walk that we took Hosmer Mr Angel was a cashier in an office in Leadenhall Street and
What office That s the worst of it Mr Holmes I don t know
Where did he live then He slept on the premises
And you don t know his address No except that it was Leadenhall Street
Where did you address your letters then To the Leadenhall Street Post Office to be left till called for He said that if they were sent to the office he
would be chaffed by all the other clerks about having letters from a lady so I offered to typewrite them like he did his but he wouldn t have that for he said that when I wrote them they seemed to come from me but when
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
they were typewritten he always felt that the machine had come between us That will just show you how fond he was of me Mr Holmes and the little things that he would think of
It was most suggestive said Holmes It has long been an axiom of mine that the little things are infinitely the most important Can you remember any other little things about Mr Hosmer Angel
He was a very shy man Mr Holmes He would rather walk with me in the evening than in the daylight for he said that he hated to be conspicuous Very retiring and gentlemanly he was Even his voice was gentle He d
had the quinsy and swollen glands when he was young he told me and it had left him with a weak throat and a hesitating whispering fashion of speech He was always well dressed very neat and plain but his eyes were
weak just as mine are and he wore tinted glasses against the glare Well and what happened when Mr Windibank your stepfather returned to France
Mr Hosmer Angel came to the house again and proposed that we should marry before father came back He was in dreadful earnest and made me swear with my hands on the Testament that whatever happened I would
always be true to him Mother said he was quite right to make me swear and that it was a sign of his passion
Mother was all in his favour from the first and was even fonder of him than I was Then when they talked of marrying within the week I began to ask about father but they both said never to mind about father but just to
tell him afterwards and mother said she would make it all right with him I didn t quite like that Mr Holmes It seemed funny that I should ask his leave as he was only a few years older than me but I didn t want to do
anything on the sly so I wrote to father at Bordeaux where the company has its French offices but the letter came back to me on the very morning of the wedding
It missed him then Yes sir for he had started to England just before it arrived
Ha that was unfortunate Your wedding was arranged then for the Friday Was it to be in church Yes sir but very quietly It was to be at St Saviour s near King s Cross and we were to have breakfast
afterwards at the St Pancras Hotel Hosmer came for us in a hansom but as there were two of us he put us both into it and stepped himself into a four wheeler which happened to be the only other cab in the street We got to
the church first and when the four wheeler drove up we waited for him to step out but he never did and when the cabman got down from the box and looked there was no one there The cabman said that he could not
imagine what had become of him for he had seen him get in with his own eyes That was last Friday Mr
Holmes and I have never seen or heard anything since then to throw any light upon what became of him It seems to me that you have been very shamefully treated said Holmes
Oh no sir He was too good and kind to leave me so Why all the morning he was saying to me that whatever happened I was to be true and that even if something quite unforeseen occurred to separate us I was
always to remember that I was pledged to him and that he would claim his pledge sooner or later It seemed strange talk for a wedding morning but what has happened since gives a meaning to it
Most certainly it does Your own opinion is then that some unforeseen catastrophe has occurred to him Yes sir I believe that he foresaw some danger or else he would not have talked so And then I think that
what he foresaw happened But you have no notion as to what it could have been
None One more question How did your mother take the matter
She was angry and said that I was never to speak of the matter again And your father Did you tell him
Yes and he seemed to think with me that something had happened and that I should hear of Hosmer again
As he said what interest could anyone have in bringing me to the doors of the church and then leaving me
Now if he had borrowed my money or if he had married me and got my money settled on him there might be some reason but Hosmer was very independent about money and never would look at a shilling of mine And
yet what could have happened And why could he not write Oh it drives me half mad to think of it and I can t sleep a wink at night She pulled a little handkerchief out of her muff and began to sob heavily into it
I shall glance into the case for you said Holmes rising and I have no doubt that we shall reach some definite result Let the weight of the matter rest upon me now and do not let your mind dwell upon it further
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Above all try to let Mr Hosmer Angel vanish from your memory as he has done from your life Then you don t think I ll see him again
I fear not Then what has happened to him
You will leave that question in my hands I should like an accurate description of him and any letters of his which you can spare
I advertised for him in last Saturday s Chronicle said she Here is the slip and here are four letters from him
Thank you And your address No Lyon Place Camberwell
Mr Angel s address you never had I understand Where is your father s place of business He travels for Westhouse Marbank the great claret importers of Fenchurch Street
Thank you You have made your statement very clearly You will leave the papers here and remember the advice which I have given you Let the whole incident be a sealed book and do not allow it to affect your life
You are very kind Mr Holmes but I cannot do that I shall be true to Hosmer He shall find me ready when he comes back
For all the preposterous hat and the vacuous face there was something noble in the simple faith of our visitor which compelled our respect She laid her little bundle of papers upon the table and went her way with a
promise to come again whenever she might be summoned
Sherlock Holmes sat silent for a few minutes with his fingertips still pressed together his legs stretched out in front of him and his gaze directed upward to the ceiling Then he took down from the rack the old and oily clay
pipe which was to him as a counsellor and having lit it he leaned back in his chair with the thick blue cloudwreaths spinning up from him and a look of infinite languor in his face
Quite an interesting study that maiden he observed I found her more interesting than her little problem which by the way is rather a trite one You will find parallel cases if you consult my index in Andover in
and there was something of the sort at The Hague last year Old as is the idea however there were one or two details which were new to me But the maiden herself was most instructive
You appeared to read a good deal upon her which was quite invisible to me I remarked
Not invisible but unnoticed Watson You did not know where to look and so you missed all that was important I can never bring you to realise the importance of sleeves the suggestiveness of thumb nails or the
great issues that may hang from a boot lace Now what did you gather from that woman s appearance Describe it
Well she had a slate coloured broad brimmed straw hat with a feather of a brickish red Her jacket was black with black beads sewn upon it and a fringe of little black jet ornaments Her dress was brown rather
darker than coffee colour with a little purple plush at the neck and sleeves Her gloves were greyish and were worn through at the right forefinger Her boots I didn t observe She had small round hanging gold earrings and
a general air of being fairly well to do in a vulgar comfortable easy going way Sherlock Holmes clapped his hands softly together and chuckled
Pon my word Watson you are coming along wonderfully You have really done very well indeed It is true that you have missed everything of importance but you have hit upon the method and you have a quick eye for
colour Never trust to general impressions my boy but concentrate yourself upon details My first glance is always at a woman s sleeve In a man it is perhaps better first to take the knee of the trouser As you observe this
woman had plush upon her sleeves which is a most useful material for showing traces The double line a little above the wrist where the typewritist presses against the table was beautifully defined The sewing machine of
the hand type leaves a similar mark but only on the left arm and on the side of it farthest from the thumb instead of being right across the broadest part as this was I then glanced at her face and observing the dint of a
pince nez at either side of her nose I ventured a remark upon short sight and typewriting which seemed to surprise her
It surprised me PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html But surely it was obvious I was then much surprised and interested on glancing down to observe that
though the boots which she was wearing were not unlike each other they were really odd ones the one having a slightly decorated toe cap and the other a plain one One was buttoned only in the two lower buttons out of five
and the other at the first third and fifth Now when you see that a young lady otherwise neatly dressed has come away from home with odd boots half buttoned it is no great deduction to say that she came away in a
hurry And what else I asked keenly interested as I always was by my friend s incisive reasoning
I noted in passing that she had written a note before leaving home but after being fully dressed You observed that her right glove was torn at the forefinger but you did not apparently see that both glove and finger
were stained with violet ink She had written in a hurry and dipped her pen too deep It must have been this morning or the mark would not remain clear upon the finger All this is amusing though rather elementary but I
must go back to business Watson Would you mind reading me the advertised description of Mr Hosmer Angel
I held the little printed slip to the light Missing it said on the morning of the fourteenth a gentleman named Hosmer Angel About five ft seven in in height strongly built sallow complexion black hair a little
bald in the centre bushy black side whiskers and moustache tinted glasses slight infirmity of speech Was dressed when last seen in black frock coat faced with silk black waistcoat gold Albert chain and grey Harris
tweed trousers with brown gaiters over elastic sided boots Known to have been employed in an office in Leadenhall Street Anybody bringing c c
That will do said Holmes As to the letters he continued glancing over them they are very commonplace Absolutely no clue in them to Mr Angel save that he quotes Balzac once There is one
remarkable point however which will no doubt strike you They are typewritten I remarked
Not only that but the signature is typewritten Look at the neat little Hosmer Angel at the bottom There is a date you see but no superscription except Leadenhall Street which is rather vague The point about the
signature is very suggestive in fact we may call it conclusive Of what
My dear fellow is it possible you do not see how strongly it bears upon the case I cannot say that I do unless it were that he wished to be able to deny his signature if an action for breach of
promise were instituted No that was not the point However I shall write two letters which should settle the matter One is to a firm
in the City the other is to the young lady s stepfather Mr Windibank asking him whether he could meet us here at six o clock to morrow evening It is just as well that we should do business with the male relatives And now
Doctor we can do nothing until the answers to those letters come so we may put our little problem upon the shelf for the interim
I had had so many reasons to believe in my friend s subtle powers of reasoning and extraordinary energy in action that I felt that he must have some solid grounds for the assured and easy demeanour with which he treated
the singular mystery which he had been called upon to fathom Once only had I known him to fail in the case of the King of Bohemia and of the Irene Adler photograph but when I looked back to the weird business of the
Sign of Four and the extraordinary circumstances connected with the Study in Scarlet I felt that it would be a strange tangle indeed which he could not unravel
I left him then still puffing at his black clay pipe with the conviction that when I came again on the next evening I would find that he held in his hands all the clues which would lead up to the identity of the
disappearing bridegroom of Miss Mary Sutherland
A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer It was not until close upon six o clock that I found myself free and was
able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street half afraid that I might be too late to assist at the d nouement of the little mystery I found Sherlock Holmes alone however half asleep with his long thin form
curled up in the recesses of his armchair A formidable array of bottles and test tubes with the pungent cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid told me that he had spent his day in the chemical work which was so dear to him
Well have you solved it I asked as I entered
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Yes It was the bisulphate of baryta No no the mystery I cried
Oh that I thought of the salt that I have been working upon There was never any mystery in the matter though as I said yesterday some of the details are of interest The only drawback is that there is no law I fear
that can touch the scoundrel Who was he then and what was his object in deserting Miss Sutherland
The question was hardly out of my mouth and Holmes had not yet opened his lips to reply when we heard a heavy footfall in the passage and a tap at the door
This is the girl s stepfather Mr James Windibank said Holmes He has written to me to say that he would be here at six Come in
The man who entered was a sturdy middle sized fellow some thirty years of age clean shaven and sallow skinned with a bland insinuating manner and a pair of wonderfully sharp and penetrating grey eyes He shot a
questioning glance at each of us placed his shiny top hat upon the sideboard and with a slight bow sidled down into the nearest chair
Good evening Mr James Windibank said Holmes I think that this typewritten letter is from you in which you made an appointment with me for six o clock
Yes sir I am afraid that I am a little late but I am not quite my own master you know I am sorry that Miss Sutherland has troubled you about this little matter for I think it is far better not to wash linen of the sort in
public It was quite against my wishes that she came but she is a very excitable impulsive girl as you may have noticed and she is not easily controlled when she has made up her mind on a point Of course I did not mind
you so much as you are not connected with the official police but it is not pleasant to have a family misfortune like this noised abroad Besides it is a useless expense for how could you possibly find this Hosmer Angel
On the contrary said Holmes quietly I have every reason to believe that I will succeed in discovering Mr
Hosmer Angel Mr Windibank gave a violent start and dropped his gloves I am delighted to hear it he said
It is a curious thing remarked Holmes that a typewriter has really quite as much individuality as a man s handwriting Unless they are quite new no two of them write exactly alike Some letters get more worn than
others and some wear only on one side Now you remark in this note of yours Mr Windibank that in every case there is some little slurring over of the e and a slight defect in the tail of the r There are fourteen other
characteristics but those are the more obvious We do all our correspondence with this machine at the office and no doubt it is a little worn our visitor
answered glancing keenly at Holmes with his bright little eyes
And now I will show you what is really a very interesting study Mr Windibank Holmes continued I think of writing another little monograph some of these days on the typewriter and its relation to crime It is a subject
to which I have devoted some little attention I have here four letters which purport to come from the missing man They are all typewritten In each case not only are the e s slurred and the r s tailless but you will
observe if you care to use my magnifying lens that the fourteen other characteristics to which I have alluded are there as well
Mr Windibank sprang out of his chair and picked up his hat I cannot waste time over this sort of fantastic talk Mr Holmes he said If you can catch the man catch him and let me know when you have done it
Certainly said Holmes stepping over and turning the key in the door I let you know then that I have caught him
What where shouted Mr Windibank turning white to his lips and glancing about him like a rat in a trap
Oh it won t do really it won t said Holmes suavely There is no possible getting out of it Mr
Windibank It is quite too transparent and it was a very bad compliment when you said that it was impossible for me to solve so simple a question That s right Sit down and let us talk it over
Our visitor collapsed into a chair with a ghastly face and a glitter of moisture on his brow It it s not actionable he stammered
I am very much afraid that it is not But between ourselves Windibank it was as cruel and selfish and heartless a trick in a petty way as ever came before me Now let me just run over the course of events and you
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
will contradict me if I go wrong The man sat huddled up in his chair with his head sunk upon his breast like one who is utterly crushed
Holmes stuck his feet up on the corner of the mantelpiece and leaning back with his hands in his pockets began talking rather to himself as it seemed than to us
The man married a woman very much older than himself for her money said he and he enjoyed the use of the money of the daughter as long as she lived with them It was a considerable sum for people in their position
and the loss of it would have made a serious difference It was worth an effort to preserve it The daughter was of a good amiable disposition but affectionate and warm hearted in her ways so that it was evident that with her
fair personal advantages and her little income she would not be allowed to remain single long Now her marriage would mean of course the loss of a hundred a year so what does her stepfather do to prevent it He
takes the obvious course of keeping her at home and forbidding her to seek the company of people of her own age But soon he found that that would not answer forever She became restive insisted upon her rights and
finally announced her positive intention of going to a certain ball What does her clever stepfather do then He conceives an idea more creditable to his head than to his heart With the connivance and assistance of his wife he
disguised himself covered those keen eyes with tinted glasses masked the face with a moustache and a pair of bushy whiskers sunk that clear voice into an insinuating whisper and doubly secure on account of the girl s
short sight he appears as Mr Hosmer Angel and keeps off other lovers by making love himself It was only a joke at first groaned our visitor We never thought that she would have been so carried
away Very likely not However that may be the young lady was very decidedly carried away and having quite
made up her mind that her stepfather was in France the suspicion of treachery never for an instant entered her mind She was flattered by the gentleman s attentions and the effect was increased by the loudly expressed
admiration of her mother Then Mr Angel began to call for it was obvious that the matter should be pushed as far as it would go if a real effect were to be produced There were meetings and an engagement which would
finally secure the girl s affections from turning towards anyone else But the deception could not be kept up forever These pretended journeys to France were rather cumbrous The thing to do was clearly to bring the
business to an end in such a dramatic manner that it would leave a permanent impression upon the young lady s mind and prevent her from looking upon any other suitor for some time to come Hence those vows of fidelity
exacted upon a Testament and hence also the allusions to a possibility of something happening on the very morning of the wedding James Windibank wished Miss Sutherland to be so bound to Hosmer Angel and so
uncertain as to his fate that for ten years to come at any rate she would not listen to another man As far as the church door he brought her and then as he could go no farther he conveniently vanished away by the old trick
of stepping in at one door of a four wheeler and out at the other I think that was the chain of events Mr
Windibank Our visitor had recovered something of his assurance while Holmes had been talking and he rose from his
chair now with a cold sneer upon his pale face
It may be so or it may not Mr Holmes said he but if you are so very sharp you ought to be sharp enough to know that it is you who are breaking the law now and not me I have done nothing actionable from the first
but as long as you keep that door locked you lay yourself open to an action for assault and illegal constraint The law cannot as you say touch you said Holmes unlocking and throwing open the door yet there never
was a man who deserved punishment more If the young lady has a brother or a friend he ought to lay a whip across your shoulders By Jove he continued flushing up at the sight of the bitter sneer upon the man s face it
is not part of my duties to my client but here s a hunting crop handy and I think I shall just treat myself to He took two swift steps to the whip but before he could grasp it there was a wild clatter of steps upon the stairs
the heavy hall door banged and from the window we could see Mr James Windibank running at the top of his speed down the road
There s a cold blooded scoundrel said Holmes laughing as he threw himself down into his chair once more That fellow will rise from crime to crime until he does something very bad and ends on a gallows The
case has in some respects been not entirely devoid of interest I cannot now entirely see all the steps of your reasoning I remarked
Well of course it was obvious from the first that this Mr Hosmer Angel must have some strong object for his curious conduct and it was equally clear that the only man who really profited by the incident as far as we could
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
see was the stepfather Then the fact that the two men were never together but that the one always appeared when the other was away was suggestive So were the tinted spectacles and the curious voice which both hinted
at a disguise as did the bushy whiskers My suspicions were all confirmed by his peculiar action in typewriting his signature which of course inferred that his handwriting was so familiar to her that she would recognise
even the smallest sample of it You see all these isolated facts together with many minor ones all pointed in the same direction
And how did you verify them Having once spotted my man it was easy to get corroboration I knew the firm for which this man worked
Having taken the printed description I eliminated everything from it which could be the result of a disguise the whiskers the glasses the voice and I sent it to the firm with a request that they would inform me whether it
answered to the description of any of their travellers I had already noticed the peculiarities of the typewriter and I wrote to the man himself at his business address asking him if he would come here As I expected his reply
was typewritten and revealed the same trivial but characteristic defects The same post brought me a letter from Westhouse Marbank of Fenchurch Street to say that the description tallied in every respect with that of their
employ James Windibank Voil tout And Miss Sutherland
If I tell her she will not believe me You may remember the old Persian saying There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman There is as much sense in
Hafiz as in Horace and as much knowledge of the world PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg

THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY We were seated at breakfast one morning my wife and I when the maid brought in a telegram It was from
Sherlock Holmes and ran in this way
Have you a couple of days to spare Have just been wired for from the west of England in connection with Boscombe Valley tragedy Shall be glad if you will come with me Air and scenery perfect Leave Paddington by
the What do you say dear said my wife looking across at me Will you go
I really don t know what to say I have a fairly long list at present Oh Anstruther would do your work for you You have been looking a little pale lately I think that the change
would do you good and you are always so interested in Mr Sherlock Holmes cases I should be ungrateful if I were not seeing what I gained through one of them I answered But if I am to
go I must pack at once for I have only half an hour My experience of camp life in Afghanistan had at least had the effect of making me a prompt and ready
traveller My wants were few and simple so that in less than the time stated I was in a cab with my valise rattling away to Paddington Station Sherlock Holmes was pacing up and down the platform his tall gaunt
figure made even gaunter and taller by his long grey travelling cloak and close fitting cloth cap
It is really very good of you to come Watson said he It makes a considerable difference to me having someone with me on whom I can thoroughly rely Local aid is always either worthless or else biassed If you will
keep the two corner seats I shall get the tickets We had the carriage to ourselves save for an immense litter of papers which Holmes had brought with him
Among these he rummaged and read with intervals of note taking and of meditation until we were past Reading Then he suddenly rolled them all into a gigantic ball and tossed them up onto the rack
Have you heard anything of the case he asked
Not a word I have not seen a paper for some days The London press has not had very full accounts I have just been looking through all the recent papers in
order to master the particulars It seems from what I gather to be one of those simple cases which are so extremely difficult
That sounds a little paradoxical But it is profoundly true Singularity is almost invariably a clue The more featureless and commonplace a
crime is the more difficult it is to bring it home In this case however they have established a very serious case against the son of the murdered man
It is a murder then Well it is conjectured to be so I shall take nothing for granted until I have the opportunity of looking
personally into it I will explain the state of things to you as far as I have been able to understand it in a very few words
Boscombe Valley is a country district not very far from Ross in Herefordshire The largest landed proprietor in that part is a Mr John Turner who made his money in Australia and returned some years ago to the old
country One of the farms which he held that of Hatherley was let to Mr Charles Mc Carthy who was also an ex Australian The men had known each other in the colonies so that it was not unnatural that when they came
to settle down they should do so as near each other as possible Turner was apparently the richer man so Mc Carthy became his tenant but still remained it seems upon terms of perfect equality as they were frequently
together Mc Carthy had one son a lad of eighteen and Turner had an only daughter of the same age but neither PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html of them had wives living They appear to have avoided the society of the neighbouring English families and to
have led retired lives though both the Mc Carthys were fond of sport and were frequently seen at the racemeetings of the neighbourhood Mc Carthy kept two servants a man and a girl Turner had a considerable household some half dozen at the least That is as much as I have been able to gather about the families Now
On June rd that is on Monday last Mc Carthy left his house at Hatherley about three in the afternoon and walked down to the Boscombe Pool which is a small lake formed by the spreading out of the stream which runs
down the Boscombe Valley He had been out with his serving man in the morning at Ross and he had told the man that he must hurry as he had an appointment of importance to keep at three From that appointment he
never came back alive
From Hatherley Farmhouse to the Boscombe Pool is a quarter of a mile and two people saw him as he passed over this ground One was an old woman whose name is not mentioned and the other was William
Crowder a game keeper in the employ of Mr Turner Both these witnesses depose that Mr Mc Carthy was walking alone The game keeper adds that within a few minutes of his seeing Mr Mc Carthy pass he had seen his
son Mr James Mc Carthy going the same way with a gun under his arm To the best of his belief the father was actually in sight at the time and the son was following him He thought no more of the matter until he heard in
the evening of the tragedy that had occurred
The two Mc Carthys were seen after the time when William Crowder the game keeper lost sight of them
The Boscombe Pool is thickly wooded round with just a fringe of grass and of reeds round the edge A girl of fourteen Patience Moran who is the daughter of the lodge keeper of the Boscombe Valley estate was in one of
the woods picking flowers She states that while she was there she saw at the border of the wood and close by the lake Mr Mc Carthy and his son and that they appeared to be having a violent quarrel She heard Mr
Mc Carthy the elder using very strong language to his son and she saw the latter raise up his hand as if to strike his father She was so frightened by their violence that she ran away and told her mother when she reached home
that she had left the two Mc Carthys quarrelling near Boscombe Pool and that she was afraid that they were going to fight She had hardly said the words when young Mr Mc Carthy came running up to the lodge to say
that he had found his father dead in the wood and to ask for the help of the lodge keeper He was much excited without either his gun or his hat and his right hand and sleeve were observed to be stained with fresh blood On
following him they found the dead body stretched out upon the grass beside the pool The head had been beaten in by repeated blows of some heavy and blunt weapon The injuries were such as might very well have been
inflicted by the butt end of his son s gun which was found lying on the grass within a few paces of the body
Under these circumstances the young man was instantly arrested and a verdict of wilful murder having been returned at the inquest on Tuesday he was on Wednesday brought before the magistrates at Ross who have
referred the case to the next Assizes Those are the main facts of the case as they came out before the coroner and the police court
I could hardly imagine a more damning case I remarked If ever circumstantial evidence pointed to a criminal it does so here
Circumstantial evidence is a very tricky thing answered Holmes thoughtfully It may seem to point very straight to one thing but if you shift your own point of view a little you may find it pointing in an equally
uncompromising manner to something entirely different It must be confessed however that the case looks exceedingly grave against the young man and it is very possible that he is indeed the culprit There are several
people in the neighbourhood however and among them Miss Turner the daughter of the neighbouring landowner who believe in his innocence and who have retained Lestrade whom you may recollect in
connection with the Study in Scarlet to work out the case in his interest Lestrade being rather puzzled has referred the case to me and hence it is that two middle aged gentlemen are flying westward at fifty miles an
hour instead of quietly digesting their breakfasts at home I am afraid said I that the facts are so obvious that you will find little credit to be gained out of this case
There is nothing more deceptive than an obvious fact he answered laughing Besides we may chance to hit upon some other obvious facts which may have been by no means obvious to Mr Lestrade You know me too
well to think that I am boasting when I say that I shall either confirm or destroy his theory by means which he is quite incapable of employing or even of understanding To take the first example to hand I very clearly perceive

that in your bedroom the window is upon the right hand side and yet I question whether Mr Lestrade would have noted even so self evident a thing as that
How on earth My dear fellow I know you well I know the military neatness which characterises you You shave every
morning and in this season you shave by the sunlight but since your shaving is less and less complete as we get farther back on the left side until it becomes positively slovenly as we get round the angle of the jaw it is surely
very clear that that side is less illuminated than the other I could not imagine a man of your habits looking at himself in an equal light and being satisfied with such a result I only quote this as a trivial example of
observation and inference Therein lies my m tier and it is just possible that it may be of some service in the investigation which lies before us There are one or two minor points which were brought out in the inquest and
which are worth considering What are they
It appears that his arrest did not take place at once but after the return to Hatherley Farm On the inspector of constabulary informing him that he was a prisoner he remarked that he was not surprised to hear it and that it
was no more than his deserts This observation of his had the natural effect of removing any traces of doubt which might have remained in the minds of the coroner s jury
It was a confession I ejaculated
No for it was followed by a protestation of innocence Coming on the top of such a damning series of events it was at least a most suspicious remark
On the contrary said Holmes it is the brightest rift which I can at present see in the clouds However innocent he might be he could not be such an absolute imbecile as not to see that the circumstances were very
black against him Had he appeared surprised at his own arrest or feigned indignation at it I should have looked upon it as highly suspicious because such surprise or anger would not be natural under the circumstances and
yet might appear to be the best policy to a scheming man His frank acceptance of the situation marks him as either an innocent man or else as a man of considerable self restraint and firmness As to his remark about his
deserts it was also not unnatural if you consider that he stood beside the dead body of his father and that there is no doubt that he had that very day so far forgotten his filial duty as to bandy words with him and even
according to the little girl whose evidence is so important to raise his hand as if to strike him The self reproach and contrition which are displayed in his remark appear to me to be the signs of a healthy mind rather than of a
guilty one I shook my head Many men have been hanged on far slighter evidence I remarked
So they have And many men have been wrongfully hanged What is the young man s own account of the matter
It is I am afraid not very encouraging to his supporters though there are one or two points in it which are suggestive You will find it here and may read it for yourself
He picked out from his bundle a copy of the local Herefordshire paper and having turned down the sheet he pointed out the paragraph in which the unfortunate young man had given his own statement of what had
occurred I settled myself down in the corner of the carriage and read it very carefully It ran in this way
Mr James Mc Carthy the only son of the deceased was then called and gave evidence as follows I had been away from home for three days at Bristol and had only just returned upon the morning of last Monday the rd
My father was absent from home at the time of my arrival and I was informed by the maid that he had driven over to Ross with John Cobb the groom Shortly after my return I heard the wheels of his trap in the yard and
looking out of my window I saw him get out and walk rapidly out of the yard though I was not aware in which direction he was going I then took my gun and strolled out in the direction of the Boscombe Pool with the
intention of visiting the rabbit warren which is upon the other side On my way I saw William Crowder the game keeper as he had stated in his evidence but he is mistaken in thinking that I was following my father I
had no idea that he was in front of me When about a hundred yards from the pool I heard a cry of Cooee which was a usual signal between my father and myself I then hurried forward and found him standing by the
pool He appeared to be much surprised at seeing me and asked me rather roughly what I was doing there A conversation ensued which led to high words and almost to blows for my father was a man of a very violent
temper Seeing that his passion was becoming ungovernable I left him and returned towards Hatherley Farm I PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html had not gone more than yards however when I heard a hideous outcry behind me which caused me to run
back again I found my father expiring upon the ground with his head terribly injured I dropped my gun and held him in my arms but he almost instantly expired I knelt beside him for some minutes and then made my
way to Mr Turner s lodge keeper his house being the nearest to ask for assistance I saw no one near my father when I returned and I have no idea how he came by his injuries He was not a popular man being somewhat
cold and forbidding in his manners but he had as far as I know no active enemies I know nothing further of the matter
The Coroner Did your father make any statement to you before he died
Witness He mumbled a few words but I could only catch some allusion to a rat
The Coroner What did you understand by that
Witness It conveyed no meaning to me I thought that he was delirious
The Coroner What was the point upon which you and your father had this final quarrel
Witness I should prefer not to answer
The Coroner I am afraid that I must press it
Witness It is really impossible for me to tell you I can assure you that it has nothing to do with the sad tragedy which followed
The Coroner That is for the court to decide I need not point out to you that your refusal to answer will prejudice your case considerably in any future proceedings which may arise
Witness I must still refuse
The Coroner I understand that the cry of Cooee was a common signal between you and your father
The Coroner How was it then that he uttered it before he saw you and before he even knew that you had returned from Bristol
Witness with considerable confusion I do not know
A Juryman Did you see nothing which aroused your suspicions when you returned on hearing the cry and found your father fatally injured
Witness Nothing definite
The Coroner What do you mean
Witness I was so disturbed and excited as I rushed out into the open that I could think of nothing except of my father Yet I have a vague impression that as I ran forward something lay upon the ground to the left of me It
seemed to me to be something grey in colour a coat of some sort or a plaid perhaps When I rose from my father I looked round for it but it was gone
Do you mean that it disappeared before you went for help Yes it was gone
You cannot say what it was No I had a feeling something was there
How far from the body A dozen yards or so
And how far from the edge of the wood About the same
Then if it was removed it was while you were within a dozen yards of it Yes but with my back towards it
This concluded the examination of the witness I see said I as I glanced down the column that the coroner in his concluding remarks was rather severe
upon young Mc Carthy He calls attention and with reason to the discrepancy about his father having signalled to him before seeing him also to his refusal to give details of his conversation with his father and his singular
account of his father s dying words They are all as he remarks very much against the son PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Holmes laughed softly to himself and stretched himself out upon the cushioned seat Both you and the
coroner have been at some pains said he to single out the very strongest points in the young man s favour
Don t you see that you alternately give him credit for having too much imagination and too little Too little if he could not invent a cause of quarrel which would give him the sympathy of the jury too much if he evolved from
his own inner consciousness anything so outr as a dying reference to a rat and the incident of the vanishing cloth No sir I shall approach this case from the point of view that what this young man says is true and we
shall see whither that hypothesis will lead us And now here is my pocket Petrarch and not another word shall I say of this case until we are on the scene of action We lunch at Swindon and I see that we shall be there in
twenty minutes It was nearly four o clock when we at last after passing through the beautiful Stroud Valley and over the
broad gleaming Severn found ourselves at the pretty little country town of Ross A lean ferret like man furtive and sly looking was waiting for us upon the platform In spite of the light brown dustcoat and leather leggings
which he wore in deference to his rustic surroundings I had no difficulty in recognising Lestrade of Scotland Yard With him we drove to the Hereford Arms where a room had already been engaged for us
I have ordered a carriage said Lestrade as we sat over a cup of tea I knew your energetic nature and that you would not be happy until you had been on the scene of the crime
It was very nice and complimentary of you Holmes answered It is entirely a question of barometric pressure
Lestrade looked startled I do not quite follow he said
How is the glass Twenty nine I see No wind and not a cloud in the sky I have a caseful of cigarettes here which need smoking and the sofa is very much superior to the usual country hotel abomination I do not think
that it is probable that I shall use the carriage to night Lestrade laughed indulgently You have no doubt already formed your conclusions from the newspapers
he said The case is as plain as a pikestaff and the more one goes into it the plainer it becomes Still of course one can t refuse a lady and such a very positive one too She has heard of you and would have your opinion
though I repeatedly told her that there was nothing which you could do which I had not already done Why bless my soul here is her carriage at the door
He had hardly spoken before there rushed into the room one of the most lovely young women that I have ever seen in my life Her violet eyes shining her lips parted a pink flush upon her cheeks all thought of her natural
reserve lost in her overpowering excitement and concern
Oh Mr Sherlock Holmes she cried glancing from one to the other of us and finally with a woman s quick intuition fastening upon my companion I am so glad that you have come I have driven down to tell you so I
know that James didn t do it I know it and I want you to start upon your work knowing it too Never let yourself doubt upon that point We have known each other since we were little children and I know his faults as
no one else does but he is too tender hearted to hurt a fly Such a charge is absurd to anyone who really knows him
I hope we may clear him Miss Turner said Sherlock Holmes You may rely upon my doing all that I can But you have read the evidence You have formed some conclusion Do you not see some loophole some
flaw Do you not yourself think that he is innocent I think that it is very probable
There now she cried throwing back her head and looking defiantly at Lestrade You hear He gives me hopes
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders I am afraid that my colleague has been a little quick in forming his conclusions he said
But he is right Oh I know that he is right James never did it And about his quarrel with his father I am sure that the reason why he would not speak about it to the coroner was because I was concerned in it
In what way asked Holmes
It is no time for me to hide anything James and his father had many disagreements about me Mr Mc Carthy was very anxious that there should be a marriage between us James and I have always loved each other as
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
brother and sister but of course he is young and has seen very little of life yet and and well he naturally did not wish to do anything like that yet So there were quarrels and this I am sure was one of them
And your father asked Holmes Was he in favour of such a union No he was averse to it also No one but Mr Mc Carthy was in favour of it A quick blush passed over her
fresh young face as Holmes shot one of his keen questioning glances at her
Thank you for this information said he May I see your father if I call to morrow I am afraid the doctor won t allow it
The doctor Yes have you not heard Poor father has never been strong for years back but this has broken him down
completely He has taken to his bed and Dr Willows says that he is a wreck and that his nervous system is shattered Mr Mc Carthy was the only man alive who had known dad in the old days in Victoria
Ha In Victoria That is important Yes at the mines
Quite so at the gold mines where as I understand Mr Turner made his money Yes certainly
Thank you Miss Turner You have been of material assistance to me You will tell me if you have any news to morrow No doubt you will go to the prison to see James Oh if you
do Mr Holmes do tell him that I know him to be innocent I will Miss Turner
I must go home now for dad is very ill and he misses me so if I leave him Good bye and God help you in your undertaking She hurried from the room as impulsively as she had entered and we heard the wheels of her
carriage rattle off down the street
I am ashamed of you Holmes said Lestrade with dignity after a few minutes silence Why should you raise up hopes which you are bound to disappoint I am not over tender of heart but I call it cruel
I think that I see my way to clearing James Mc Carthy said Holmes Have you an order to see him in prison
Yes but only for you and me Then I shall reconsider my resolution about going out We have still time to take a train to Hereford and see
him to night Ample
Then let us do so Watson I fear that you will find it very slow but I shall only be away a couple of hours I walked down to the station with them and then wandered through the streets of the little town finally
returning to the hotel where I lay upon the sofa and tried to interest myself in a yellow backed novel The puny plot of the story was so thin however when compared to the deep mystery through which we were groping and
I found my attention wander so continually from the action to the fact that I at last flung it across the room and gave myself up entirely to a consideration of the events of the day Supposing that this unhappy young man s
story were absolutely true then what hellish thing what absolutely unforeseen and extraordinary calamity could have occurred between the time when he parted from his father and the moment when drawn back by his
screams he rushed into the glade It was something terrible and deadly What could it be Might not the nature of the injuries reveal something to my medical instincts I rang the bell and called for the weekly county paper
which contained a verbatim account of the inquest In the surgeon s deposition it was stated that the posterior third of the left parietal bone and the left half of the occipital bone had been shattered by a heavy blow from a
blunt weapon I marked the spot upon my own head Clearly such a blow must have been struck from behind
That was to some extent in favour of the accused as when seen quarrelling he was face to face with his father
Still it did not go for very much for the older man might have turned his back before the blow fell Still it might be worth while to call Holmes attention to it Then there was the peculiar dying reference to a rat What
could that mean It could not be delirium A man dying from a sudden blow does not commonly become delirious No it was more likely to be an attempt to explain how he met his fate But what could it indicate I
cudgelled my brains to find some possible explanation And then the incident of the grey cloth seen by young PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Mc Carthy If that were true the murderer must have dropped some part of his dress presumably his overcoat in
his flight and must have had the hardihood to return and to carry it away at the instant when the son was kneeling with his back turned not a dozen paces off What a tissue of mysteries and improbabilities the whole
thing was I did not wonder at Lestrade s opinion and yet I had so much faith in Sherlock Holmes insight that I could not lose hope as long as every fresh fact seemed to strengthen his conviction of young Mc Carthy s
It was late before Sherlock Holmes returned He came back alone for Lestrade was staying in lodgings in the town
The glass still keeps very high he remarked as he sat down It is of importance that it should not rain before we are able to go over the ground On the other hand a man should be at his very best and keenest for
such nice work as that and I did not wish to do it when fagged by a long journey I have seen young Mc Carthy And what did you learn from him
Nothing Could he throw no light
None at all I was inclined to think at one time that he knew who had done it and was screening him or her but I am convinced now that he is as puzzled as everyone else He is not a very quick witted youth though
comely to look at and I should think sound at heart I cannot admire his taste I remarked if it is indeed a fact that he was averse to a marriage with so
charming a young lady as this Miss Turner Ah thereby hangs a rather painful tale This fellow is madly insanely in love with her but some two years
ago when he was only a lad and before he really knew her for she had been away five years at a boardingschool what does the idiot do but get into the clutches of a barmaid in Bristol and marry her at a registry office
No one knows a word of the matter but you can imagine how maddening it must be to him to be upbraided for not doing what he would give his very eyes to do but what he knows to be absolutely impossible It was sheer
frenzy of this sort which made him throw his hands up into the air when his father at their last interview was goading him on to propose to Miss Turner On the other hand he had no means of supporting himself and his
father who was by all accounts a very hard man would have thrown him over utterly had he known the truth It was with his barmaid wife that he had spent the last three days in Bristol and his father did not know where he
was Mark that point It is of importance Good has come out of evil however for the barmaid finding from the papers that he is in serious trouble and likely to be hanged has thrown him over utterly and has written to him to
say that she has a husband already in the Bermuda Dockyard so that there is really no tie between them I think that that bit of news has consoled young Mc Carthy for all that he has suffered
But if he is innocent who has done it Ah who I would call your attention very particularly to two points One is that the murdered man had an
appointment with someone at the pool and that the someone could not have been his son for his son was away and he did not know when he would return The second is that the murdered man was heard to cry Cooee
before he knew that his son had returned Those are the crucial points upon which the case depends And now let us talk about George Meredith if you please and we shall leave all minor matters until to morrow
There was no rain as Holmes had foretold and the morning broke bright and cloudless At nine o clock Lestrade called for us with the carriage and we set off for Hatherley Farm and the Boscombe Pool
There is serious news this morning Lestrade observed It is said that Mr Turner of the Hall is so ill that his life is despaired of
An elderly man I presume said Holmes
About sixty but his constitution has been shattered by his life abroad and he has been in failing health for some time This business has had a very bad effect upon him He was an old friend of Mc Carthy s and I may
add a great benefactor to him for I have learned that he gave him Hatherley Farm rent free Indeed That is interesting said Holmes
Oh yes In a hundred other ways he has helped him Everybody about here speaks of his kindness to him Really Does it not strike you as a little singular that this Mc Carthy who appears to have had little of his
own and to have been under such obligations to Turner should still talk of marrying his son to Turner s PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html daughter who is presumably heiress to the estate and that in such a very cocksure manner as if it were merely
a case of a proposal and all else would follow It is the more strange since we know that Turner himself was averse to the idea The daughter told us as much Do you not deduce something from that
We have got to the deductions and the inferences said Lestrade winking at me I find it hard enough to tackle facts Holmes without flying away after theories and fancies
You are right said Holmes demurely you do find it very hard to tackle the facts Anyhow I have grasped one fact which you seem to find it difficult to get hold of replied Lestrade with
And that is That Mc Carthy senior met his death from Mc Carthy junior and that all theories to the contrary are the merest
moonshine Well moonshine is a brighter thing than fog said Holmes laughing But I am very much mistaken if this is
not Hatherley Farm upon the left Yes that is it It was a widespread comfortable looking building two storied slate roofed with great
yellow blotches of lichen upon the grey walls The drawn blinds and the smokeless chimneys however gave it a stricken look as though the weight of this horror still lay heavy upon it We called at the door when the maid at
Holmes request showed us the boots which her master wore at the time of his death and also a pair of the son s though not the pair which he had then had Having measured these very carefully from seven or eight different
points Holmes desired to be led to the court yard from which we all followed the winding track which led to Boscombe Pool
Sherlock Holmes was transformed when he was hot upon such a scent as this Men who had only known the quiet thinker and logician of Baker Street would have failed to recognise him His face flushed and darkened
His brows were drawn into two hard black lines while his eyes shone out from beneath them with a steely glitter His face was bent downward his shoulders bowed his lips compressed and the veins stood out like
whipcord in his long sinewy neck His nostrils seemed to dilate with a purely animal lust for the chase and his mind was so absolutely concentrated upon the matter before him that a question or remark fell unheeded upon
his ears or at the most only provoked a quick impatient snarl in reply Swiftly and silently he made his way along the track which ran through the meadows and so by way of the woods to the Boscombe Pool It was
damp marshy ground as is all that district and there were marks of many feet both upon the path and amid the short grass which bounded it on either side Sometimes Holmes would hurry on sometimes stop dead and once
he made quite a little detour into the meadow Lestrade and I walked behind him the detective indifferent and contemptuous while I watched my friend with the interest which sprang from the conviction that every one of
his actions was directed towards a definite end
The Boscombe Pool which is a little reed girt sheet of water some fifty yards across is situated at the boundary between the Hatherley Farm and the private park of the wealthy Mr Turner Above the woods which
lined it upon the farther side we could see the red jutting pinnacles which marked the site of the rich landowner s dwelling On the Hatherley side of the pool the woods grew very thick and there was a narrow belt
of sodden grass twenty paces across between the edge of the trees and the reeds which lined the lake Lestrade showed us the exact spot at which the body had been found and indeed so moist was the ground that I could
plainly see the traces which had been left by the fall of the stricken man To Holmes as I could see by his eager face and peering eyes very many other things were to be read upon the trampled grass He ran round like a dog
who is picking up a scent and then turned upon my companion
What did you go into the pool for he asked
I fished about with a rake I thought there might be some weapon or other trace But how on earth Oh tut tut I have no time That left foot of yours with its inward twist is all over the place A mole could
trace it and there it vanishes among the reeds Oh how simple it would all have been had I been here before they came like a herd of buffalo and wallowed all over it Here is where the party with the lodge keeper came
and they have covered all tracks for six or eight feet round the body But here are three separate tracks of the same feet He drew out a lens and lay down upon his waterproof to have a better view talking all the time rather
to himself than to us These are young Mc Carthy s feet Twice he was walking and once he ran swiftly so that the soles are deeply marked and the heels hardly visible That bears out his story He ran when he saw his father
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
on the ground Then here are the father s feet as he paced up and down What is this then It is the butt end of the gun as the son stood listening And this Ha ha What have we here Tiptoes tiptoes Square too quite
unusual boots They come they go they come again of course that was for the cloak Now where did they come from He ran up and down sometimes losing sometimes finding the track until we were well within the
edge of the wood and under the shadow of a great beech the largest tree in the neighbourhood Holmes traced his way to the farther side of this and lay down once more upon his face with a little cry of satisfaction For a
long time he remained there turning over the leaves and dried sticks gathering up what seemed to me to be dust into an envelope and examining with his lens not only the ground but even the bark of the tree as far as he could
reach A jagged stone was lying among the moss and this also he carefully examined and retained Then he followed a pathway through the wood until he came to the high road where all traces were lost
It has been a case of considerable interest he remarked returning to his natural manner I fancy that this grey house on the right must be the lodge I think that I will go in and have a word with Moran and perhaps
write a little note Having done that we may drive back to our luncheon You may walk to the cab and I shall be with you presently
It was about ten minutes before we regained our cab and drove back into Ross Holmes still carrying with him the stone which he had picked up in the wood
This may interest you Lestrade he remarked holding it out The murder was done with it I see no marks
There are none How do you know then
The grass was growing under it It had only lain there a few days There was no sign of a place whence it had been taken It corresponds with the injuries There is no sign of any other weapon
And the murderer Is a tall man left handed limps with the right leg wears thick soled shooting boots and a grey cloak smokes
Indian cigars uses a cigar holder and carries a blunt pen knife in his pocket There are several other indications but these may be enough to aid us in our search
Lestrade laughed I am afraid that I am still a sceptic he said Theories are all very well but we have to deal with a hard headed British jury
Nous verrons answered Holmes calmly You work your own method and I shall work mine I shall be busy this afternoon and shall probably return to London by the evening train
And leave your case unfinished No finished
But the mystery It is solved
Who was the criminal then The gentleman I describe
But who is he Surely it would not be difficult to find out This is not such a populous neighbourhood
Lestrade shrugged his shoulders I am a practical man he said and I really cannot undertake to go about the country looking for a left handed gentleman with a game leg I should become the laughing stock of
Scotland Yard All right said Holmes quietly I have given you the chance Here are your lodgings Good bye I shall drop
you a line before I leave Having left Lestrade at his rooms we drove to our hotel where we found lunch upon the table Holmes was
silent and buried in thought with a pained expression upon his face as one who finds himself in a perplexing position
Look here Watson he said when the cloth was cleared just sit down in this chair and let me preach to you for a little I don t know quite what to do and I should value your advice Light a cigar and let me expound
Pray do so PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Well now in considering this case there are two points about young Mc Carthy s narrative which struck us
both instantly although they impressed me in his favour and you against him One was the fact that his father should according to his account cry Cooee before seeing him The other was his singular dying reference to a
rat He mumbled several words you understand but that was all that caught the son s ear Now from this double point our research must commence and we will begin it by presuming that what the lad says is absolutely true
What of this Cooee then Well obviously it could not have been meant for the son The son as far as he knew was in Bristol It was
mere chance that he was within earshot The Cooee was meant to attract the attention of whoever it was that he had the appointment with But Cooee is a distinctly Australian cry and one which is used between Australians
There is a strong presumption that the person whom Mc Carthy expected to meet him at Boscombe Pool was someone who had been in Australia
What of the rat then Sherlock Holmes took a folded paper from his pocket and flattened it out on the table This is a map of the
Colony of Victoria he said I wired to Bristol for it last night He put his hand over part of the map What do you read
And now He raised his hand
BALLARAT Quite so That was the word the man uttered and of which his son only caught the last two syllables He was
trying to utter the name of his murderer So and so of Ballarat It is wonderful I exclaimed
It is obvious And now you see I had narrowed the field down considerably The possession of a grey garment was a third point which granting the son s statement to be correct was a certainty We have come now
out of mere vagueness to the definite conception of an Australian from Ballarat with a grey cloak Certainly
And one who was at home in the district for the pool can only be approached by the farm or by the estate where strangers could hardly wander
Quite so Then comes our expedition of to day By an examination of the ground I gained the trifling details which I
gave to that imbecile Lestrade as to the personality of the criminal But how did you gain them
You know my method It is founded upon the observation of trifles His height I know that you might roughly judge from the length of his stride His boots too might be told
from their traces Yes they were peculiar boots
But his lameness The impression of his right foot was always less distinct than his left He put less weight upon it Why
Because he limped he was lame But his left handedness
You were yourself struck by the nature of the injury as recorded by the surgeon at the inquest The blow was struck from immediately behind and yet was upon the left side Now how can that be unless it were by a lefthanded man He had stood behind that tree during the interview between the father and son He had even
smoked there I found the ash of a cigar which my special knowledge of tobacco ashes enables me to pronounce as an Indian cigar I have as you know devoted some attention to this and written a little monograph on the
ashes of different varieties of pipe cigar and cigarette tobacco Having found the ash I then looked round and discovered the stump among the moss where he had tossed it It was an Indian cigar of the variety which are
rolled in Rotterdam And the cigar holder
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I could see that the end had not been in his mouth Therefore he used a holder The tip had been cut off not bitten off but the cut was not a clean one so I deduced a blunt pen knife
Holmes I said you have drawn a net round this man from which he cannot escape and you have saved an innocent human life as truly as if you had cut the cord which was hanging him I see the direction in which all
this points The culprit is Mr John Turner cried the hotel waiter opening the door of our sitting room and ushering in a visitor
The man who entered was a strange and impressive figure His slow limping step and bowed shoulders gave the appearance of decrepitude and yet his hard deep lined craggy features and his enormous limbs showed that
he was possessed of unusual strength of body and of character His tangled beard grizzled hair and outstanding drooping eyebrows combined to give an air of dignity and power to his appearance but his face was of an ashen
white while his lips and the corners of his nostrils were tinged with a shade of blue It was clear to me at a glance that he was in the grip of some deadly and chronic disease
Pray sit down on the sofa said Holmes gently You had my note Yes the lodge keeper brought it up You said that you wished to see me here to avoid scandal
I thought people would talk if I went to the Hall And why did you wish to see me He looked across at my companion with despair in his weary eyes as
though his question was already answered
Yes said Holmes answering the look rather than the words It is so I know all about Mc Carthy The old man sank his face in his hands God help me he cried But I would not have let the young man
come to harm I give you my word that I would have spoken out if it went against him at the Assizes I am glad to hear you say so said Holmes gravely
I would have spoken now had it not been for my dear girl It would break her heart it will break her heart when she hears that I am arrested
It may not come to that said Holmes
What I am no official agent I understand that it was your daughter who required my presence here and I am acting
in her interests Young Mc Carthy must be got off however I am a dying man said old Turner I have had diabetes for years My doctor says it is a question whether I
shall live a month Yet I would rather die under my own roof than in a gaol Holmes rose and sat down at the table with his pen in his hand and a bundle of paper before him Just tell us
the truth he said I shall jot down the facts You will sign it and Watson here can witness it Then I could produce your confession at the last extremity to save young Mc Carthy I promise you that I shall not use it unless
it is absolutely needed It s as well said the old man it s a question whether I shall live to the Assizes so it matters little to me but
I should wish to spare Alice the shock And now I will make the thing clear to you it has been a long time in the acting but will not take me long to tell
You didn t know this dead man Mc Carthy He was a devil incarnate I tell you that God keep you out of the clutches of such a man as he His grip has been upon me these twenty years and he has blasted my life I ll tell
you first how I came to be in his power
It was in the early s at the diggings I was a young chap then hot blooded and reckless ready to turn my hand at anything I got among bad companions took to drink had no luck with my claim took to the bush and
in a word became what you would call over here a highway robber There were six of us and we had a wild free life of it sticking up a station from time to time or stopping the wagons on the road to the diggings Black Jack
of Ballarat was the name I went under and our party is still remembered in the colony as the Ballarat Gang
One day a gold convoy came down from Ballarat to Melbourne and we lay in wait for it and attacked it
There were six troopers and six of us so it was a close thing but we emptied four of their saddles at the first volley Three of our boys were killed however before we got the swag I put my pistol to the head of the wagondriver who was this very man Mc Carthy I wish to the Lord that I had shot him then but I spared him though I
saw his wicked little eyes fixed on my face as though to remember every feature We got away with the gold became wealthy men and made our way over to England without being suspected There I parted from my old

pals and determined to settle down to a quiet and respectable life I bought this estate which chanced to be in the market and I set myself to do a little good with my money to make up for the way in which I had earned it I
married too and though my wife died young she left me my dear little Alice Even when she was just a baby her wee hand seemed to lead me down the right path as nothing else had ever done In a word I turned over a new
leaf and did my best to make up for the past All was going well when Mc Carthy laid his grip upon me
I had gone up to town about an investment and I met him in Regent Street with hardly a coat to his back or a boot to his foot
Here we are Jack says he touching me on the arm we ll be as good as a family to you There s two of us me and my son and you can have the keeping of us If you don t it s a fine law abiding country is England
and there s always a policeman within hail Well down they came to the west country there was no shaking them off and there they have lived rent free
on my best land ever since There was no rest for me no peace no forgetfulness turn where I would there was his cunning grinning face at my elbow It grew worse as Alice grew up for he soon saw I was more afraid of her
knowing my past than of the police Whatever he wanted he must have and whatever it was I gave him without question land money houses until at last he asked a thing which I could not give He asked for Alice
His son you see had grown up and so had my girl and as I was known to be in weak health it seemed a fine stroke to him that his lad should step into the whole property But there I was firm I would not have his
cursed stock mixed with mine not that I had any dislike to the lad but his blood was in him and that was enough I stood firm Mc Carthy threatened I braved him to do his worst We were to meet at the pool midway
between our houses to talk it over
When I went down there I found him talking with his son so I smoked a cigar and waited behind a tree until he should be alone But as I listened to his talk all that was black and bitter in me seemed to come uppermost He
was urging his son to marry my daughter with as little regard for what she might think as if she were a slut from off the streets It drove me mad to think that I and all that I held most dear should be in the power of such a man
as this Could I not snap the bond I was already a dying and a desperate man Though clear of mind and fairly strong of limb I knew that my own fate was sealed But my memory and my girl Both could be saved if I could
but silence that foul tongue I did it Mr Holmes I would do it again Deeply as I have sinned I have led a life of martyrdom to atone for it But that my girl should be entangled in the same meshes which held me was more
than I could suffer I struck him down with no more compunction than if he had been some foul and venomous beast His cry brought back his son but I had gained the cover of the wood though I was forced to go back to
fetch the cloak which I had dropped in my flight That is the true story gentlemen of all that occurred Well it is not for me to judge you said Holmes as the old man signed the statement which had been drawn
out I pray that we may never be exposed to such a temptation I pray not sir And what do you intend to do
In view of your health nothing You are yourself aware that you will soon have to answer for your deed at a higher court than the Assizes I will keep your confession and if Mc Carthy is condemned I shall be forced to use
it If not it shall never be seen by mortal eye and your secret whether you be alive or dead shall be safe with us
Farewell then said the old man solemnly Your own deathbeds when they come will be the easier for the thought of the peace which you have given to mine Tottering and shaking in all his giant frame he stumbled
slowly from the room
God help us said Holmes after a long silence Why does fate play such tricks with poor helpless worms I never hear of such a case as this that I do not think of Baxter s words and say There but for the grace of God
goes Sherlock Holmes James Mc Carthy was acquitted at the Assizes on the strength of a number of objections which had been drawn
out by Holmes and submitted to the defending counsel Old Turner lived for seven months after our interview but he is now dead and there is every prospect that the son and daughter may come to live happily together in
ignorance of the black cloud which rests upon their past

THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS When I glance over my notes and records of the Sherlock Holmes cases between the years and I am
faced by so many which present strange and interesting features that it is no easy matter to know which to choose and which to leave Some however have already gained publicity through the papers and others have
not offered a field for those peculiar qualities which my friend possessed in so high a degree and which it is the object of these papers to illustrate Some too have baffled his analytical skill and would be as narratives
beginnings without an ending while others have been but partially cleared up and have their explanations founded rather upon conjecture and surmise than on that absolute logical proof which was so dear to him There
is however one of these last which was so remarkable in its details and so startling in its results that I am tempted to give some account of it in spite of the fact that there are points in connection with it which never have
been and probably never will be entirely cleared up
The year furnished us with a long series of cases of greater or less interest of which I retain the records
Among my headings under this one twelve months I find an account of the adventure of the Paradol Chamber of the Amateur Mendicant Society who held a luxurious club in the lower vault of a furniture warehouse of the
facts connected with the loss of the British barque Sophy Anderson of the singular adventures of the Grice Patersons in the island of Uffa and finally of the Camberwell poisoning case In the latter as may be
remembered Sherlock Holmes was able by winding up the dead man s watch to prove that it had been wound up two hours before and that therefore the deceased had gone to bed within that time a deduction which was
of the greatest importance in clearing up the case All these I may sketch out at some future date but none of them present such singular features as the strange train of circumstances which I have now taken up my pen to
It was in the latter days of September and the equinoctial gales had set in with exceptional violence All day the wind had screamed and the rain had beaten against the windows so that even here in the heart of great handmade London we were forced to raise our minds for the instant from the routine of life and to recognise the
presence of those great elemental forces which shriek at mankind through the bars of his civilisation like untamed beasts in a cage As evening drew in the storm grew higher and louder and the wind cried and sobbed
like a child in the chimney Sherlock Holmes sat moodily at one side of the fireplace cross indexing his records of crime while I at the other was deep in one of Clark Russell s fine sea stories until the howl of the gale from
without seemed to blend with the text and the splash of the rain to lengthen out into the long swash of the sea waves My wife was on a visit to her mother s and for a few days I was a dweller once more in my old quarters
Why said I glancing up at my companion that was surely the bell Who could come to night Some friend of yours perhaps
Except yourself I have none he answered I do not encourage visitors A client then
If so it is a serious case Nothing less would bring a man out on such a day and at such an hour But I take it that it is more likely to be some crony of the landlady s
Sherlock Holmes was wrong in his conjecture however for there came a step in the passage and a tapping at the door He stretched out his long arm to turn the lamp away from himself and towards the vacant chair upon
which a newcomer must sit
The man who entered was young some two and twenty at the outside well groomed and trimly clad with something of refinement and delicacy in his bearing The streaming umbrella which he held in his hand and his
long shining waterproof told of the fierce weather through which he had come He looked about him anxiously PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html in the glare of the lamp and I could see that his face was pale and his eyes heavy like those of a man who is
weighed down with some great anxiety
I owe you an apology he said raising his golden pince nez to his eyes I trust that I am not intruding I fear that I have brought some traces of the storm and rain into your snug chamber
Give me your coat and umbrella said Holmes They may rest here on the hook and will be dry presently
You have come up from the south west I see Yes from Horsham
That clay and chalk mixture which I see upon your toe caps is quite distinctive I have come for advice
That is easily got And help
That is not always so easy I have heard of you Mr Holmes I heard from Major Prendergast how you saved him in the Tankerville Club
scandal Ah of course He was wrongfully accused of cheating at cards
He said that you could solve anything He said too much
That you are never beaten I have been beaten four times three times by men and once by a woman
But what is that compared with the number of your successes It is true that I have been generally successful
Then you may be so with me I beg that you will draw your chair up to the fire and favour me with some details as to your case
It is no ordinary one None of those which come to me are I am the last court of appeal
And yet I question sir whether in all your experience you have ever listened to a more mysterious and inexplicable chain of events than those which have happened in my own family
You fill me with interest said Holmes Pray give us the essential facts from the commencement and I can afterwards question you as to those details which seem to me to be most important
The young man pulled his chair up and pushed his wet feet out towards the blaze
My name said he is John Openshaw but my own affairs have as far as I can understand little to do with this awful business It is a hereditary matter so in order to give you an idea of the facts I must go back to the
commencement of the affair
You must know that my grandfather had two sons my uncle Elias and my father Joseph My father had a small factory at Coventry which he enlarged at the time of the invention of bicycling He was a patentee of the
Openshaw unbreakable tire and his business met with such success that he was able to sell it and to retire upon a handsome competence
My uncle Elias emigrated to America when he was a young man and became a planter in Florida where he was reported to have done very well At the time of the war he fought in Jackson s army and afterwards under
Hood where he rose to be a colonel When Lee laid down his arms my uncle returned to his plantation where he remained for three or four years About or he came back to Europe and took a small estate in Sussex
near Horsham He had made a very considerable fortune in the States and his reason for leaving them was his aversion to the negroes and his dislike of the Republican policy in extending the franchise to them He was a
singular man fierce and quick tempered very foul mouthed when he was angry and of a most retiring disposition During all the years that he lived at Horsham I doubt if ever he set foot in the town He had a garden
and two or three fields round his house and there he would take his exercise though very often for weeks on end he would never leave his room He drank a great deal of brandy and smoked very heavily but he would see no
society and did not want any friends not even his own brother
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
He didn t mind me in fact he took a fancy to me for at the time when he saw me first I was a youngster of twelve or so This would be in the year after he had been eight or nine years in England He begged my
father to let me live with him and he was very kind to me in his way When he was sober he used to be fond of playing backgammon and draughts with me and he would make me his representative both with the servants
and with the tradespeople so that by the time that I was sixteen I was quite master of the house I kept all the keys and could go where I liked and do what I liked so long as I did not disturb him in his privacy There was
one singular exception however for he had a single room a lumber room up among the attics which was invariably locked and which he would never permit either me or anyone else to enter With a boy s curiosity I
have peeped through the keyhole but I was never able to see more than such a collection of old trunks and bundles as would be expected in such a room
One day it was in March a letter with a foreign stamp lay upon the table in front of the colonel s plate It was not a common thing for him to receive letters for his bills were all paid in ready money and he had
no friends of any sort From India said he as he took it up Pondicherry postmark What can this be Opening it hurriedly out there jumped five little dried orange pips which pattered down upon his plate I began to laugh
at this but the laugh was struck from my lips at the sight of his face His lip had fallen his eyes were protruding his skin the colour of putty and he glared at the envelope which he still held in his trembling hand K K K he
shrieked and then My God my God my sins have overtaken me What is it uncle I cried
Death said he and rising from the table he retired to his room leaving me palpitating with horror I took up the envelope and saw scrawled in red ink upon the inner flap just above the gum the letter K three times
repeated There was nothing else save the five dried pips What could be the reason of his overpowering terror I left the breakfast table and as I ascended the stair I met him coming down with an old rusty key which must
have belonged to the attic in one hand and a small brass box like a cashbox in the other
They may do what they like but I ll checkmate them still said he with an oath Tell Mary that I shall want a fire in my room to day and send down to Fordham the Horsham lawyer
I did as he ordered and when the lawyer arrived I was asked to step up to the room The fire was burning brightly and in the grate there was a mass of black fluffy ashes as of burned paper while the brass box stood
open and empty beside it As I glanced at the box I noticed with a start that upon the lid was printed the treble K which I had read in the morning upon the envelope
I wish you John said my uncle to witness my will I leave my estate with all its advantages and all its disadvantages to my brother your father whence it will no doubt descend to you If you can enjoy it in peace
well and good If you find you cannot take my advice my boy and leave it to your deadliest enemy I am sorry to give you such a two edged thing but I can t say what turn things are going to take Kindly sign the paper
where Mr Fordham shows you I signed the paper as directed and the lawyer took it away with him The singular incident made as you may
think the deepest impression upon me and I pondered over it and turned it every way in my mind without being able to make anything of it Yet I could not shake off the vague feeling of dread which it left behind though the
sensation grew less keen as the weeks passed and nothing happened to disturb the usual routine of our lives I could see a change in my uncle however He drank more than ever and he was less inclined for any sort of
society Most of his time he would spend in his room with the door locked upon the inside but sometimes he would emerge in a sort of drunken frenzy and would burst out of the house and tear about the garden with a
revolver in his hand screaming out that he was afraid of no man and that he was not to be cooped up like a sheep in a pen by man or devil When these hot fits were over however he would rush tumultuously in at the
door and lock and bar it behind him like a man who can brazen it out no longer against the terror which lies at the roots of his soul At such times I have seen his face even on a cold day glisten with moisture as though it
were new raised from a basin
Well to come to an end of the matter Mr Holmes and not to abuse your patience there came a night when he made one of those drunken sallies from which he never came back We found him when we went to search
for him face downward in a little green scummed pool which lay at the foot of the garden There was no sign of any violence and the water was but two feet deep so that the jury having regard to his known eccentricity
brought in a verdict of suicide But I who knew how he winced from the very thought of death had much ado PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html to persuade myself that he had gone out of his way to meet it The matter passed however and my father entered
into possession of the estate and of some which lay to his credit at the bank One moment Holmes interposed your statement is I foresee one of the most remarkable to which I have
ever listened Let me have the date of the reception by your uncle of the letter and the date of his supposed suicide
The letter arrived on March His death was seven weeks later upon the night of May nd Thank you Pray proceed
When my father took over the Horsham property he at my request made a careful examination of the attic which had been always locked up We found the brass box there although its contents had been destroyed On
the inside of the cover was a paper label with the initials of K K K repeated upon it and Letters memoranda receipts and a register written beneath These we presume indicated the nature of the papers which had been
destroyed by Colonel Openshaw For the rest there was nothing of much importance in the attic save a great many scattered papers and note books bearing upon my uncle s life in America Some of them were of the war
time and showed that he had done his duty well and had borne the repute of a brave soldier Others were of a date during the reconstruction of the Southern states and were mostly concerned with politics for he had
evidently taken a strong part in opposing the carpet bag politicians who had been sent down from the North
Well it was the beginning of when my father came to live at Horsham and all went as well as possible with us until the January of On the fourth day after the new year I heard my father give a sharp cry of
surprise as we sat together at the breakfast table There he was sitting with a newly opened envelope in one hand and five dried orange pips in the outstretched palm of the other one He had always laughed at what he
called my cock and bull story about the colonel but he looked very scared and puzzled now that the same thing had come upon himself
Why what on earth does this mean John he stammered
My heart had turned to lead It is K K K said I
He looked inside the envelope So it is he cried Here are the very letters But what is this written above them
Put the papers on the sundial I read peeping over his shoulder
What papers What sundial he asked
The sundial in the garden There is no other said I but the papers must be those that are destroyed Pooh said he gripping hard at his courage We are in a civilised land here and we can t have tomfoolery
of this kind Where does the thing come from From Dundee I answered glancing at the postmark
Some preposterous practical joke said he What have I to do with sundials and papers I shall take no notice of such nonsense
I should certainly speak to the police I said
And be laughed at for my pains Nothing of the sort Then let me do so
No I forbid you I won t have a fuss made about such nonsense It was in vain to argue with him for he was a very obstinate man I went about however with a heart which
was full of forebodings
On the third day after the coming of the letter my father went from home to visit an old friend of his Major Freebody who is in command of one of the forts upon Portsdown Hill I was glad that he should go for it
seemed to me that he was farther from danger when he was away from home In that however I was in error
Upon the second day of his absence I received a telegram from the major imploring me to come at once My father had fallen over one of the deep chalk pits which abound in the neighbourhood and was lying senseless
with a shattered skull I hurried to him but he passed away without having ever recovered his consciousness He had as it appears been returning from Fareham in the twilight and as the country was unknown to him and the
chalk pit unfenced the jury had no hesitation in bringing in a verdict of death from accidental causes Carefully as I examined every fact connected with his death I was unable to find anything which could suggest the idea of
murder There were no signs of violence no footmarks no robbery no record of strangers having been seen PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html upon the roads And yet I need not tell you that my mind was far from at ease and that I was well nigh certain
that some foul plot had been woven round him
In this sinister way I came into my inheritance You will ask me why I did not dispose of it I answer because I was well convinced that our troubles were in some way dependent upon an incident in my uncle s life
and that the danger would be as pressing in one house as in another
It was in January that my poor father met his end and two years and eight months have elapsed since then During that time I have lived happily at Horsham and I had begun to hope that this curse had passed away
from the family and that it had ended with the last generation I had begun to take comfort too soon however
yesterday morning the blow fell in the very shape in which it had come upon my father The young man took from his waistcoat a crumpled envelope and turning to the table he shook out upon it
five little dried orange pips
This is the envelope he continued The postmark is London eastern division Within are the very words which were upon my father s last message K K K and then Put the papers on the sundial
What have you done asked Holmes
To tell the truth he sank his face into his thin white hands I have felt helpless I have felt like one of those poor rabbits when the snake is writhing towards it I seem to be in the grasp of some resistless inexorable
evil which no foresight and no precautions can guard against Tut tut cried Sherlock Holmes You must act man or you are lost Nothing but energy can save you This
is no time for despair I have seen the police
Ah But they listened to my story with a smile I am convinced that the inspector has formed the opinion that the
letters are all practical jokes and that the deaths of my relations were really accidents as the jury stated and were not to be connected with the warnings
Holmes shook his clenched hands in the air Incredible imbecility he cried
They have however allowed me a policeman who may remain in the house with me Has he come with you to night
No His orders were to stay in the house Again Holmes raved in the air
Why did you come to me he said and above all why did you not come at once I did not know It was only to day that I spoke to Major Prendergast about my troubles and was advised by
him to come to you It is really two days since you had the letter We should have acted before this You have no further evidence
I suppose than that which you have placed before us no suggestive detail which might help us There is one thing said John Openshaw He rummaged in his coat pocket and drawing out a piece of
discoloured blue tinted paper he laid it out upon the table I have some remembrance said he that on the day when my uncle burned the papers I observed that the small unburned margins which lay amid the ashes
were of this particular colour I found this single sheet upon the floor of his room and I am inclined to think that it may be one of the papers which has perhaps fluttered out from among the others and in that way has escaped
destruction Beyond the mention of pips I do not see that it helps us much I think myself that it is a page from some private diary The writing is undoubtedly my uncle s
Holmes moved the lamp and we both bent over the sheet of paper which showed by its ragged edge that it had indeed been torn from a book It was headed March and beneath were the following enigmatical
th Hudson came Same old platform
th Set the pips on Mc Cauley Paramore and John Swain of St Augustine
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
th Mc Cauley cleared
th John Swain cleared
th Visited Paramore All well Thank you said Holmes folding up the paper and returning it to our visitor And now you must on no
account lose another instant We cannot spare time even to discuss what you have told me You must get home instantly and act
What shall I do There is but one thing to do It must be done at once You must put this piece of paper which you have shown
us into the brass box which you have described You must also put in a note to say that all the other papers were burned by your uncle and that this is the only one which remains You must assert that in such words as will
carry conviction with them Having done this you must at once put the box out upon the sundial as directed Do you understand
Entirely Do not think of revenge or anything of the sort at present I think that we may gain that by means of the
law but we have our web to weave while theirs is already woven The first consideration is to remove the pressing danger which threatens you The second is to clear up the mystery and to punish the guilty parties
I thank you said the young man rising and pulling on his overcoat You have given me fresh life and hope
I shall certainly do as you advise Do not lose an instant And above all take care of yourself in the meanwhile for I do not think that there can
be a doubt that you are threatened by a very real and imminent danger How do you go back By train from Waterloo
It is not yet nine The streets will be crowded so I trust that you may be in safety And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely
I am armed That is well To morrow I shall set to work upon your case
I shall see you at Horsham then No your secret lies in London It is there that I shall seek it
Then I shall call upon you in a day or in two days with news as to the box and the papers I shall take your advice in every particular He shook hands with us and took his leave Outside the wind still screamed and the
rain splashed and pattered against the windows This strange wild story seemed to have come to us from amid the mad elements blown in upon us like a sheet of sea weed in a gale and now to have been reabsorbed by
Sherlock Holmes sat for some time in silence with his head sunk forward and his eyes bent upon the red glow of the fire Then he lit his pipe and leaning back in his chair he watched the blue smoke rings as they chased
each other up to the ceiling
I think Watson he remarked at last that of all our cases we have had none more fantastic than this Save perhaps the Sign of Four
Well yes Save perhaps that And yet this John Openshaw seems to me to be walking amid even greater perils than did the Sholtos
But have you I asked formed any definite conception as to what these perils are There can be no question as to their nature he answered
Then what are they Who is this K K K and why does he pursue this unhappy family Sherlock Holmes closed his eyes and placed his elbows upon the arms of his chair with his finger tips
together The ideal reasoner he remarked would when he had once been shown a single fact in all its bearings deduce from it not only all the chain of events which led up to it but also all the results which would
follow from it As Cuvier could correctly describe a whole animal by the contemplation of a single bone so the observer who has thoroughly understood one link in a series of incidents should be able to accurately state all the
other ones both before and after We have not yet grasped the results which the reason alone can attain to
Problems may be solved in the study which have baffled all those who have sought a solution by the aid of their PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html senses To carry the art however to its highest pitch it is necessary that the reasoner should be able to utilise all
the facts which have come to his knowledge and this in itself implies as you will readily see a possession of all knowledge which even in these days of free education and encyclop dias is a somewhat rare accomplishment
It is not so impossible however that a man should possess all knowledge which is likely to be useful to him in his work and this I have endeavoured in my case to do If I remember rightly you on one occasion in the early
days of our friendship defined my limits in a very precise fashion Yes I answered laughing It was a singular document Philosophy astronomy and politics were marked at
zero I remember Botany variable geology profound as regards the mud stains from any region within fifty miles of town chemistry eccentric anatomy unsystematic sensational literature and crime records unique
violin player boxer swordsman lawyer and self poisoner by cocaine and tobacco Those I think were the main points of my analysis
Holmes grinned at the last item Well he said I say now as I said then that a man should keep his little brain attic stocked with all the furniture that he is likely to use and the rest he can put away in the lumber room
of his library where he can get it if he wants it Now for such a case as the one which has been submitted to us to night we need certainly to muster all our resources Kindly hand me down the letter K of the American
Encyclop dia which stands upon the shelf beside you Thank you Now let us consider the situation and see what may be deduced from it In the first place we may start with a strong presumption that Colonel Openshaw
had some very strong reason for leaving America Men at his time of life do not change all their habits and exchange willingly the charming climate of Florida for the lonely life of an English provincial town His extreme
love of solitude in England suggests the idea that he was in fear of someone or something so we may assume as a working hypothesis that it was fear of someone or something which drove him from America As to what it
was he feared we can only deduce that by considering the formidable letters which were received by himself and his successors Did you remark the postmarks of those letters
The first was from Pondicherry the second from Dundee and the third from London From East London What do you deduce from that
They are all seaports That the writer was on board of a ship Excellent We have already a clue There can be no doubt that the probability the strong probability is that
the writer was on board of a ship And now let us consider another point In the case of Pondicherry seven weeks elapsed between the threat and its fulfilment in Dundee it was only some three or four days Does that suggest
anything A greater distance to travel
But the letter had also a greater distance to come Then I do not see the point
There is at least a presumption that the vessel in which the man or men are is a sailing ship It looks as if they always send their singular warning or token before them when starting upon their mission You see how quickly
the deed followed the sign when it came from Dundee If they had come from Pondicherry in a steamer they would have arrived almost as soon as their letter But as a matter of fact seven weeks elapsed I think that those
seven weeks represented the difference between the mail boat which brought the letter and the sailing vessel which brought the writer
It is possible More than that It is probable And now you see the deadly urgency of this new case and why I urged young
Openshaw to caution The blow has always fallen at the end of the time which it would take the senders to travel the distance But this one comes from London and therefore we cannot count upon delay
Good God I cried What can it mean this relentless persecution The papers which Openshaw carried are obviously of vital importance to the person or persons in the sailing
ship I think that it is quite clear that there must be more than one of them A single man could not have carried out two deaths in such a way as to deceive a coroner s jury There must have been several in it and they must
have been men of resource and determination Their papers they mean to have be the holder of them who it may
In this way you see K K K ceases to be the initials of an individual and becomes the badge of a society But of what society

Have you never said Sherlock Holmes bending forward and sinking his voice have you never heard of the Ku Klux Klan
I never have Holmes turned over the leaves of the book upon his knee Here it is said he presently
Ku Klux Klan A name derived from the fanciful resemblance to the sound produced by cocking a rifle This terrible secret society was formed by some ex Confederate soldiers in the Southern states after the Civil War and
it rapidly formed local branches in different parts of the country notably in Tennessee Louisiana the Carolinas Georgia and Florida Its power was used for political purposes principally for the terrorising of the negro voters
and the murdering and driving from the country of those who were opposed to its views Its outrages were usually preceded by a warning sent to the marked man in some fantastic but generally recognised shape a sprig
of oak leaves in some parts melon seeds or orange pips in others On receiving this the victim might either openly abjure his former ways or might fly from the country If he braved the matter out death would
unfailingly come upon him and usually in some strange and unforeseen manner So perfect was the organisation of the society and so systematic its methods that there is hardly a case upon record where any man succeeded in
braving it with impunity or in which any of its outrages were traced home to the perpetrators For some years the organisation flourished in spite of the efforts of the United States government and of the better classes of the
community in the South Eventually in the year the movement rather suddenly collapsed although there have been sporadic outbreaks of the same sort since that date
You will observe said Holmes laying down the volume that the sudden breaking up of the society was coincident with the disappearance of Openshaw from America with their papers It may well have been cause
and effect It is no wonder that he and his family have some of the more implacable spirits upon their track You can understand that this register and diary may implicate some of the first men in the South and that there may
be many who will not sleep easy at night until it is recovered Then the page we have seen
Is such as we might expect It ran if I remember right sent the pips to A B and C that is sent the society s warning to them Then there are successive entries that A and B cleared or left the country and finally
that C was visited with I fear a sinister result for C Well I think Doctor that we may let some light into this dark place and I believe that the only chance young Openshaw has in the meantime is to do what I have told
him There is nothing more to be said or to be done to night so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellow men
It had cleared in the morning and the sun was shining with a subdued brightness through the dim veil which hangs over the great city Sherlock Holmes was already at breakfast when I came down
You will excuse me for not waiting for you said he I have I foresee a very busy day before me in looking into this case of young Openshaw s
What steps will you take I asked
It will very much depend upon the results of my first inquiries I may have to go down to Horsham after all You will not go there first
No I shall commence with the City Just ring the bell and the maid will bring up your coffee As I waited I lifted the unopened newspaper from the table and glanced my eye over it It rested upon a
heading which sent a chill to my heart
Holmes I cried you are too late Ah said he laying down his cup I feared as much How was it done He spoke calmly but I could see
that he was deeply moved
My eye caught the name of Openshaw and the heading Tragedy Near Waterloo Bridge Here is the account
Between nine and ten last night Police Constable Cook of the H Division on duty near Waterloo Bridge heard a cry for help and a splash in the water The night however was extremely dark and stormy so that in
spite of the help of several passers by it was quite impossible to effect a rescue The alarm however was given and by the aid of the water police the body was eventually recovered It proved to be that of a young gentleman
whose name as it appears from an envelope which was found in his pocket was John Openshaw and whose PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html residence is near Horsham It is conjectured that he may have been hurrying down to catch the last train from
Waterloo Station and that in his haste and the extreme darkness he missed his path and walked over the edge of one of the small landing places for river steamboats The body exhibited no traces of violence and there can be
no doubt that the deceased had been the victim of an unfortunate accident which should have the effect of calling the attention of the authorities to the condition of the riverside landing stages
We sat in silence for some minutes Holmes more depressed and shaken than I had ever seen him
That hurts my pride Watson he said at last It is a petty feeling no doubt but it hurts my pride It becomes a personal matter with me now and if God sends me health I shall set my hand upon this gang That he should
come to me for help and that I should send him away to his death He sprang from his chair and paced about the room in uncontrollable agitation with a flush upon his sallow cheeks and a nervous clasping and unclasping
of his long thin hands
They must be cunning devils he exclaimed at last How could they have decoyed him down there The Embankment is not on the direct line to the station The bridge no doubt was too crowded even on such a night
for their purpose Well Watson we shall see who will win in the long run I am going out now To the police
No I shall be my own police When I have spun the web they may take the flies but not before All day I was engaged in my professional work and it was late in the evening before I returned to Baker
Street Sherlock Holmes had not come back yet It was nearly ten o clock before he entered looking pale and worn He walked up to the sideboard and tearing a piece from the loaf he devoured it voraciously washing it
down with a long draught of water
You are hungry I remarked
Starving It had escaped my memory I have had nothing since breakfast Nothing
Not a bite I had no time to think of it And how have you succeeded
Well You have a clue
I have them in the hollow of my hand Young Openshaw shall not long remain unavenged Why Watson let us put their own devilish trade mark upon them It is well thought of
What do you mean He took an orange from the cupboard and tearing it to pieces he squeezed out the pips upon the table Of
these he took five and thrust them into an envelope On the inside of the flap he wrote S H for J O Then he sealed it and addressed it to Captain James Calhoun Barque Lone Star Savannah Georgia
That will await him when he enters port said he chuckling It may give him a sleepless night He will find it as sure a precursor of his fate as Openshaw did before him
And who is this Captain Calhoun The leader of the gang I shall have the others but he first
How did you trace it then He took a large sheet of paper from his pocket all covered with dates and names
I have spent the whole day said he over Lloyd s registers and files of the old papers following the future career of every vessel which touched at Pondicherry in January and February in There were thirty six ships
of fair tonnage which were reported there during those months Of these one the Lone Star instantly attracted my attention since although it was reported as having cleared from London the name is that which is given to
one of the states of the Union Texas I think
I was not and am not sure which but I knew that the ship must have an American origin What then
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I searched the Dundee records and when I found that the barque Lone Star was there in January my suspicion became a certainty I then inquired as to the vessels which lay at present in the port of London
Yes The Lone Star had arrived here last week I went down to the Albert Dock and found that she had been taken
down the river by the early tide this morning homeward bound to Savannah I wired to Gravesend and learned that she had passed some time ago and as the wind is easterly I have no doubt that she is now past the Goodwins
and not very far from the Isle of Wight What will you do then
Oh I have my hand upon him He and the two mates are as I learn the only native born Americans in the ship The others are Finns and Germans I know also that they were all three away from the ship last night I
had it from the stevedore who has been loading their cargo By the time that their sailing ship reaches Savannah the mail boat will have carried this letter and the cable will have informed the police of Savannah that these
three gentlemen are badly wanted here upon a charge of murder There is ever a flaw however in the best laid of human plans and the murderers of John Openshaw were
never to receive the orange pips which would show them that another as cunning and as resolute as themselves was upon their track Very long and very severe were the equinoctial gales that year We waited long for news of
the Lone Star of Savannah but none ever reached us We did at last hear that somewhere far out in the Atlantic a shattered stern post of a boat was seen swinging in the trough of a wave with the letters L S carved upon it
and that is all which we shall ever know of the fate of the Lone Star

THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP Isa Whitney brother of the late Elias Whitney D D Principal of the Theological College of St George s was
much addicted to opium The habit grew upon him as I understand from some foolish freak when he was at college for having read De Quincey s description of his dreams and sensations he had drenched his tobacco
with laudanum in an attempt to produce the same effects He found as so many more have done that the practice is easier to attain than to get rid of and for many years he continued to be a slave to the drug an object
of mingled horror and pity to his friends and relatives I can see him now with yellow pasty face drooping lids and pin point pupils all huddled in a chair the wreck and ruin of a noble man
One night it was in June there came a ring to my bell about the hour when a man gives his first yawn and glances at the clock I sat up in my chair and my wife laid her needle work down in her lap and made a little
face of disappointment
A patient said she You ll have to go out I groaned for I was newly come back from a weary day
We heard the door open a few hurried words and then quick steps upon the linoleum Our own door flew open and a lady clad in some dark coloured stuff with a black veil entered the room
You will excuse my calling so late she began and then suddenly losing her self control she ran forward threw her arms about my wife s neck and sobbed upon her shoulder Oh I m in such trouble she cried I do
so want a little help Why said my wife pulling up her veil it is Kate Whitney How you startled me Kate I had not an idea
who you were when you came in I didn t know what to do so I came straight to you That was always the way Folk who were in grief came
to my wife like birds to a lighthouse
It was very sweet of you to come Now you must have some wine and water and sit here comfortably and tell us all about it Or should you rather that I sent James off to bed
Oh no no I want the doctor s advice and help too It s about Isa He has not been home for two days I am so frightened about him
It was not the first time that she had spoken to us of her husband s trouble to me as a doctor to my wife as an old friend and school companion We soothed and comforted her by such words as we could find Did she know
where her husband was Was it possible that we could bring him back to her
It seems that it was She had the surest information that of late he had when the fit was on him made use of an opium den in the farthest east of the City Hitherto his orgies had always been confined to one day and he had
come back twitching and shattered in the evening But now the spell had been upon him eight and forty hours and he lay there doubtless among the dregs of the docks breathing in the poison or sleeping off the effects
There he was to be found she was sure of it at the Bar of Gold in Upper Swandam Lane But what was she to do How could she a young and timid woman make her way into such a place and pluck her husband out from
among the ruffians who surrounded him
There was the case and of course there was but one way out of it Might I not escort her to this place And then as a second thought why should she come at all I was Isa Whitney s medical adviser and as such I had
influence over him I could manage it better if I were alone I promised her on my word that I would send him home in a cab within two hours if he were indeed at the address which she had given me And so in ten minutes I
had left my armchair and cheery sitting room behind me and was speeding eastward in a hansom on a strange errand as it seemed to me at the time though the future only could show how strange it was to be
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
But there was no great difficulty in the first stage of my adventure Upper Swandam Lane is a vile alley lurking behind the high wharves which line the north side of the river to the east of London Bridge Between a
slop shop and a gin shop approached by a steep flight of steps leading down to a black gap like the mouth of a cave I found the den of which I was in search Ordering my cab to wait I passed down the steps worn hollow in
the centre by the ceaseless tread of drunken feet and by the light of a flickering oil lamp above the door I found the latch and made my way into a long low room thick and heavy with the brown opium smoke and terraced
with wooden berths like the forecastle of an emigrant ship
Through the gloom one could dimly catch a glimpse of bodies lying in strange fantastic poses bowed shoulders bent knees heads thrown back and chins pointing upward with here and there a dark lack lustre eye
turned upon the newcomer Out of the black shadows there glimmered little red circles of light now bright now faint as the burning poison waxed or waned in the bowls of the metal pipes The most lay silent but some
muttered to themselves and others talked together in a strange low monotonous voice their conversation coming in gushes and then suddenly tailing off into silence each mumbling out his own thoughts and paying
little heed to the words of his neighbour At the farther end was a small brazier of burning charcoal beside which on a three legged wooden stool there sat a tall thin old man with his jaw resting upon his two fists and his
elbows upon his knees staring into the fire
As I entered a sallow Malay attendant had hurried up with a pipe for me and a supply of the drug beckoning me to an empty berth
Thank you I have not come to stay said I There is a friend of mine here Mr Isa Whitney and I wish to speak with him
There was a movement and an exclamation from my right and peering through the gloom I saw Whitney pale haggard and unkempt staring out at me
My God It s Watson said he He was in a pitiable state of reaction with every nerve in a twitter I say Watson what o clock is it
Nearly eleven Of what day
Of Friday June th Good heavens I thought it was Wednesday It is Wednesday What d you want to frighten a chap for He
sank his face onto his arms and began to sob in a high treble key
I tell you that it is Friday man Your wife has been waiting this two days for you You should be ashamed of yourself
So I am But you ve got mixed Watson for I have only been here a few hours three pipes four pipes I forget how many But I ll go home with you I wouldn t frighten Kate poor little Kate Give me your hand
Have you a cab Yes I have one waiting
Then I shall go in it But I must owe something Find what I owe Watson I am all off colour I can do nothing for myself
I walked down the narrow passage between the double row of sleepers holding my breath to keep out the vile stupefying fumes of the drug and looking about for the manager As I passed the tall man who sat by the brazier
I felt a sudden pluck at my skirt and a low voice whispered Walk past me and then look back at me The words fell quite distinctly upon my ear I glanced down They could only have come from the old man at my
side and yet he sat now as absorbed as ever very thin very wrinkled bent with age an opium pipe dangling down from between his knees as though it had dropped in sheer lassitude from his fingers I took two steps
forward and looked back It took all my self control to prevent me from breaking out into a cry of astonishment
He had turned his back so that none could see him but I His form had filled out his wrinkles were gone the dull eyes had regained their fire and there sitting by the fire and grinning at my surprise was none other than
Sherlock Holmes He made a slight motion to me to approach him and instantly as he turned his face half round to the company once more subsided into a doddering loose lipped senility
Holmes I whispered what on earth are you doing in this den PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html As low as you can he answered I have excellent ears If you would have the great kindness to get rid of
that sottish friend of yours I should be exceedingly glad to have a little talk with you I have a cab outside
Then pray send him home in it You may safely trust him for he appears to be too limp to get into any mischief I should recommend you also to send a note by the cabman to your wife to say that you have thrown in
your lot with me If you will wait outside I shall be with you in five minutes It was difficult to refuse any of Sherlock Holmes requests for they were always so exceedingly definite and
put forward with such a quiet air of mastery I felt however that when Whitney was once confined in the cab my mission was practically accomplished and for the rest I could not wish anything better than to be associated
with my friend in one of those singular adventures which were the normal condition of his existence In a few minutes I had written my note paid Whitney s bill led him out to the cab and seen him driven through the
darkness In a very short time a decrepit figure had emerged from the opium den and I was walking down the street with Sherlock Holmes For two streets he shuffled along with a bent back and an uncertain foot Then
glancing quickly round he straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter
I suppose Watson said he that you imagine that I have added opium smoking to cocaine injections and all the other little weaknesses on which you have favoured me with your medical views
I was certainly surprised to find you there But not more so than I to find you
I came to find a friend And I to find an enemy
An enemy Yes one of my natural enemies or shall I say my natural prey Briefly Watson I am in the midst of a very
remarkable inquiry and I have hoped to find a clue in the incoherent ramblings of these sots as I have done before now Had I been recognised in that den my life would not have been worth an hour s purchase for I have
used it before now for my own purposes and the rascally Lascar who runs it has sworn to have vengeance upon me There is a trap door at the back of that building near the corner of Paul s Wharf which could tell some
strange tales of what has passed through it upon the moonless nights What You do not mean bodies
Ay bodies Watson We should be rich men if we had for every poor devil who has been done to death in that den It is the vilest murder trap on the whole riverside and I fear that Neville St Clair has entered it never
to leave it more But our trap should be here He put his two forefingers between his teeth and whistled shrilly a signal which was answered by a similar whistle from the distance followed shortly by the rattle of wheels
and the clink of horses hoofs
Now Watson said Holmes as a tall dog cart dashed up through the gloom throwing out two golden tunnels of yellow light from its side lanterns You ll come with me won t you
If I can be of use Oh a trusty comrade is always of use and a chronicler still more so My room at The Cedars is a double
bedded one The Cedars
Yes that is Mr St Clair s house I am staying there while I conduct the inquiry Where is it then
Near Lee in Kent We have a seven mile drive before us But I am all in the dark
Of course you are You ll know all about it presently Jump up here All right John we shall not need you
Here s half a crown Look out for me to morrow about eleven Give her her head So long then He flicked the horse with his whip and we dashed away through the endless succession of sombre and
deserted streets which widened gradually until we were flying across a broad balustraded bridge with the murky river flowing sluggishly beneath us Beyond lay another dull wilderness of bricks and mortar its silence
broken only by the heavy regular footfall of the policeman or the songs and shouts of some belated party of PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html revellers A dull wrack was drifting slowly across the sky and a star or two twinkled dimly here and there
through the rifts of the clouds Holmes drove in silence with his head sunk upon his breast and the air of a man who is lost in thought while I sat beside him curious to learn what this new quest might be which seemed to tax
his powers so sorely and yet afraid to break in upon the current of his thoughts We had driven several miles and were beginning to get to the fringe of the belt of suburban villas when he shook himself shrugged his
shoulders and lit up his pipe with the air of a man who has satisfied himself that he is acting for the best
You have a grand gift of silence Watson said he It makes you quite invaluable as a companion Pon my word it is a great thing for me to have someone to talk to for my own thoughts are not over pleasant I was
wondering what I should say to this dear little woman to night when she meets me at the door You forget that I know nothing about it
I shall just have time to tell you the facts of the case before we get to Lee It seems absurdly simple and yet somehow I can get nothing to go upon There s plenty of thread no doubt but I can t get the end of it into my
hand Now I ll state the case clearly and concisely to you Watson and maybe you can see a spark where all is dark to me
Proceed then Some years ago to be definite in May there came to Lee a gentleman Neville St Clair by name
who appeared to have plenty of money He took a large villa laid out the grounds very nicely and lived generally in good style By degrees he made friends in the neighbourhood and in he married the daughter
of a local brewer by whom he now has two children He had no occupation but was interested in several companies and went into town as a rule in the morning returning by the from Cannon Street every night
Mr St Clair is now thirty seven years of age is a man of temperate habits a good husband a very affectionate father and a man who is popular with all who know him I may add that his whole debts at the present moment
as far as we have been able to ascertain amount to s while he has standing to his credit in the Capital and Counties Bank There is no reason therefore to think that money troubles have been weighing upon
Last Monday Mr Neville St Clair went into town rather earlier than usual remarking before he started that he had two important commissions to perform and that he would bring his little boy home a box of bricks Now
by the merest chance his wife received a telegram upon this same Monday very shortly after his departure to the effect that a small parcel of considerable value which she had been expecting was waiting for her at the
offices of the Aberdeen Shipping Company Now if you are well up in your London you will know that the office of the company is in Fresno Street which branches out of Upper Swandam Lane where you found me tonight Mrs St Clair had her lunch started for the City did some shopping proceeded to the company s office
got her packet and found herself at exactly walking through Swandam Lane on her way back to the station
Have you followed me so far It is very clear
If you remember Monday was an exceedingly hot day and Mrs St Clair walked slowly glancing about in the hope of seeing a cab as she did not like the neighbourhood in which she found herself While she was
walking in this way down Swandam Lane she suddenly heard an ejaculation or cry and was struck cold to see her husband looking down at her and as it seemed to her beckoning to her from a second floor window The
window was open and she distinctly saw his face which she describes as being terribly agitated He waved his hands frantically to her and then vanished from the window so suddenly that it seemed to her that he had been
plucked back by some irresistible force from behind One singular point which struck her quick feminine eye was that although he wore some dark coat such as he had started to town in he had on neither collar nor necktie
Convinced that something was amiss with him she rushed down the steps for the house was none other than the opium den in which you found me to night and running through the front room she attempted to
ascend the stairs which led to the first floor At the foot of the stairs however she met this Lascar scoundrel of whom I have spoken who thrust her back and aided by a Dane who acts as assistant there pushed her out into
the street Filled with the most maddening doubts and fears she rushed down the lane and by rare good fortune met in Fresno Street a number of constables with an inspector all on their way to their beat The inspector and
two men accompanied her back and in spite of the continued resistance of the proprietor they made their way to the room in which Mr St Clair had last been seen There was no sign of him there In fact in the whole of that
floor there was no one to be found save a crippled wretch of hideous aspect who it seems made his home there
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Both he and the Lascar stoutly swore that no one else had been in the front room during the afternoon So determined was their denial that the inspector was staggered and had almost come to believe that Mrs St Clair
had been deluded when with a cry she sprang at a small deal box which lay upon the table and tore the lid from it Out there fell a cascade of children s bricks It was the toy which he had promised to bring home
This discovery and the evident confusion which the cripple showed made the inspector realise that the matter was serious The rooms were carefully examined and results all pointed to an abominable crime The
front room was plainly furnished as a sitting room and led into a small bedroom which looked out upon the back of one of the wharves Between the wharf and the bedroom window is a narrow strip which is dry at low
tide but is covered at high tide with at least four and a half feet of water The bedroom window was a broad one and opened from below On examination traces of blood were to be seen upon the windowsill and several
scattered drops were visible upon the wooden floor of the bedroom Thrust away behind a curtain in the front room were all the clothes of Mr Neville St Clair with the exception of his coat His boots his socks his hat
and his watch all were there There were no signs of violence upon any of these garments and there were no other traces of Mr Neville St Clair Out of the window he must apparently have gone for no other exit could be
discovered and the ominous bloodstains upon the sill gave little promise that he could save himself by swimming for the tide was at its very highest at the moment of the tragedy
And now as to the villains who seemed to be immediately implicated in the matter The Lascar was known to be a man of the vilest antecedents but as by Mrs St Clair s story he was known to have been at the foot of the
stair within a very few seconds of her husband s appearance at the window he could hardly have been more than an accessory to the crime His defence was one of absolute ignorance and he protested that he had no knowledge
as to the doings of Hugh Boone his lodger and that he could not account in any way for the presence of the missing gentleman s clothes
So much for the Lascar manager Now for the sinister cripple who lives upon the second floor of the opium den and who was certainly the last human being whose eyes rested upon Neville St Clair His name is Hugh
Boone and his hideous face is one which is familiar to every man who goes much to the City He is a professional beggar though in order to avoid the police regulations he pretends to a small trade in wax vestas
Some little distance down Threadneedle Street upon the left hand side there is as you may have remarked a small angle in the wall Here it is that this creature takes his daily seat cross legged with his tiny stock of
matches on his lap and as he is a piteous spectacle a small rain of charity descends into the greasy leather cap which lies upon the pavement beside him I have watched the fellow more than once before ever I thought of
making his professional acquaintance and I have been surprised at the harvest which he has reaped in a short time His appearance you see is so remarkable that no one can pass him without observing him A shock of
orange hair a pale face disfigured by a horrible scar which by its contraction has turned up the outer edge of his upper lip a bulldog chin and a pair of very penetrating dark eyes which present a singular contrast to the
colour of his hair all mark him out from amid the common crowd of mendicants and so too does his wit for he is ever ready with a reply to any piece of chaff which may be thrown at him by the passers by This is the man
whom we now learn to have been the lodger at the opium den and to have been the last man to see the gentleman of whom we are in quest
But a cripple said I What could he have done single handed against a man in the prime of life He is a cripple in the sense that he walks with a limp but in other respects he appears to be a powerful and
well nurtured man Surely your medical experience would tell you Watson that weakness in one limb is often compensated for by exceptional strength in the others
Pray continue your narrative Mrs St Clair had fainted at the sight of the blood upon the window and she was escorted home in a cab by
the police as her presence could be of no help to them in their investigations Inspector Barton who had charge of the case made a very careful examination of the premises but without finding anything which threw any light
upon the matter One mistake had been made in not arresting Boone instantly as he was allowed some few minutes during which he might have communicated with his friend the Lascar but this fault was soon remedied
and he was seized and searched without anything being found which could incriminate him There were it is true some blood stains upon his right shirt sleeve but he pointed to his ring finger which had been cut near the
nail and explained that the bleeding came from there adding that he had been to the window not long before and that the stains which had been observed there came doubtless from the same source He denied strenuously
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
having ever seen Mr Neville St Clair and swore that the presence of the clothes in his room was as much a mystery to him as to the police As to Mrs St Clair s assertion that she had actually seen her husband at the
window he declared that she must have been either mad or dreaming He was removed loudly protesting to the police station while the inspector remained upon the premises in the hope that the ebbing tide might afford some
And it did though they hardly found upon the mud bank what they had feared to find It was Neville St
Clair s coat and not Neville St Clair which lay uncovered as the tide receded And what do you think they found in the pockets
I cannot imagine No I don t think you would guess Every pocket stuffed with pennies and half pennies pennies and
half pennies It was no wonder that it had not been swept away by the tide But a human body is a different matter There is a fierce eddy between the wharf and the house It seemed likely enough that the weighted coat
had remained when the stripped body had been sucked away into the river But I understand that all the other clothes were found in the room Would the body be dressed in a coat
alone No sir but the facts might be met speciously enough Suppose that this man Boone had thrust Neville St
Clair through the window there is no human eye which could have seen the deed What would he do then It would of course instantly strike him that he must get rid of the tell tale garments He would seize the coat then
and be in the act of throwing it out when it would occur to him that it would swim and not sink He has little time for he has heard the scuffle downstairs when the wife tried to force her way up and perhaps he has already
heard from his Lascar confederate that the police are hurrying up the street There is not an instant to be lost He rushes to some secret hoard where he has accumulated the fruits of his beggary and he stuffs all the coins upon
which he can lay his hands into the pockets to make sure of the coat s sinking He throws it out and would have done the same with the other garments had not he heard the rush of steps below and only just had time to close
the window when the police appeared It certainly sounds feasible
Well we will take it as a working hypothesis for want of a better Boone as I have told you was arrested and taken to the station but it could not be shown that there had ever before been anything against him He had for
years been known as a professional beggar but his life appeared to have been a very quiet and innocent one
There the matter stands at present and the questions which have to be solved what Neville St Clair was doing in the opium den what happened to him when there where is he now and what Hugh Boone had to do with his
disappearance are all as far from a solution as ever I confess that I cannot recall any case within my experience which looked at the first glance so simple and yet which presented such difficulties
While Sherlock Holmes had been detailing this singular series of events we had been whirling through the outskirts of the great town until the last straggling houses had been left behind and we rattled along with a
country hedge upon either side of us Just as he finished however we drove through two scattered villages where a few lights still glimmered in the windows
We are on the outskirts of Lee said my companion We have touched on three English counties in our short drive starting in Middlesex passing over an angle of Surrey and ending in Kent See that light among the trees
That is The Cedars and beside that lamp sits a woman whose anxious ears have already I have little doubt caught the clink of our horse s feet
But why are you not conducting the case from Baker Street I asked
Because there are many inquiries which must be made out here Mrs St Clair has most kindly put two rooms at my disposal and you may rest assured that she will have nothing but a welcome for my friend and colleague I
hate to meet her Watson when I have no news of her husband Here we are Whoa there whoa We had pulled up in front of a large villa which stood within its own grounds A stable boy had run out to the
horse s head and springing down I followed Holmes up the small winding gravel drive which led to the house
As we approached the door flew open and a little blonde woman stood in the opening clad in some sort of light mousseline de soie with a touch of fluffy pink chiffon at her neck and wrists She stood with her figure outlined
against the flood of light one hand upon the door one half raised in her eagerness her body slightly bent her head and face protruded with eager eyes and parted lips a standing question
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Well she cried well And then seeing that there were two of us she gave a cry of hope which sank into a groan as she saw that my companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders
No good news None
Thank God for that But come in You must be weary for you have had a long day This is my friend Dr Watson He has been of most vital use to me in several of my cases and a lucky chance
has made it possible for me to bring him out and associate him with this investigation I am delighted to see you said she pressing my hand warmly You will I am sure forgive anything that
may be wanting in our arrangements when you consider the blow which has come so suddenly upon us My dear madam said I I am an old campaigner and if I were not I can very well see that no apology is
needed If I can be of any assistance either to you or to my friend here I shall be indeed happy Now Mr Sherlock Holmes said the lady as we entered a well lit dining room upon the table of which a
cold supper had been laid out I should very much like to ask you one or two plain questions to which I beg that you will give a plain answer
Certainly madam Do not trouble about my feelings I am not hysterical nor given to fainting I simply wish to hear your real
real opinion Upon what point
In your heart of hearts do you think that Neville is alive Sherlock Holmes seemed to be embarrassed by the question Frankly now she repeated standing upon the
rug and looking keenly down at him as he leaned back in a basket chair
Frankly then madam I do not You think that he is dead
I don t say that Perhaps And on what day did he meet his death
On Monday Then perhaps Mr Holmes you will be good enough to explain how it is that I have received a letter from
him to day Sherlock Holmes sprang out of his chair as if he had been galvanised
Yes to day She stood smiling holding up a little slip of paper in the air
May I see it Certainly
He snatched it from her in his eagerness and smoothing it out upon the table he drew over the lamp and examined it intently I had left my chair and was gazing at it over his shoulder The envelope was a very coarse
one and was stamped with the Gravesend postmark and with the date of that very day or rather of the day before for it was considerably after midnight
Coarse writing murmured Holmes Surely this is not your husband s writing madam No but the enclosure is

deep black shade This man has written the name and there has then been a pause before he wrote the address which can only mean that he was not familiar with it It is of course a trifle but there is nothing so important as
trifles Let us now see the letter Ha there has been an enclosure here Yes there was a ring His signet ring
And you are sure that this is your husband s hand One of his hands
One His hand when he wrote hurriedly It is very unlike his usual writing and yet I know it well
Dearest do not be frightened All will come well There is a huge error which it may take some little time to rectify Wait in patience NEVILLE Written in pencil upon the fly leaf of a book octavo size no water mark
Hum Posted to day in Gravesend by a man with a dirty thumb Ha And the flap has been gummed if I am not very much in error by a person who had been chewing tobacco And you have no doubt that it is your husband s
hand madam None Neville wrote those words
And they were posted to day at Gravesend Well Mrs St Clair the clouds lighten though I should not venture to say that the danger is over
But he must be alive Mr Holmes Unless this is a clever forgery to put us on the wrong scent The ring after all proves nothing It may have
been taken from him No no it is it is his very own writing
Very well It may however have been written on Monday and only posted to day That is possible
If so much may have happened between Oh you must not discourage me Mr Holmes I know that all is well with him There is so keen a sympathy
between us that I should know if evil came upon him On the very day that I saw him last he cut himself in the bedroom and yet I in the dining room rushed upstairs instantly with the utmost certainty that something had
happened Do you think that I would respond to such a trifle and yet be ignorant of his death I have seen too much not to know that the impression of a woman may be more valuable than the conclusion
of an analytical reasoner And in this letter you certainly have a very strong piece of evidence to corroborate your view But if your husband is alive and able to write letters why should he remain away from you
I cannot imagine It is unthinkable And on Monday he made no remarks before leaving you
No And you were surprised to see him in Swandam Lane
Very much so Was the window open
Yes Then he might have called to you
He might He only as I understand gave an inarticulate cry
Yes A call for help you thought
Yes He waved his hands But it might have been a cry of surprise Astonishment at the unexpected sight of you might cause him to
throw up his hands It is possible
And you thought he was pulled back PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html He disappeared so suddenly
He might have leaped back You did not see anyone else in the room No but this horrible man confessed to having been there and the Lascar was at the foot of the stairs
Quite so Your husband as far as you could see had his ordinary clothes on But without his collar or tie I distinctly saw his bare throat
Had he ever spoken of Swandam Lane Never
Had he ever showed any signs of having taken opium Never
Thank you Mrs St Clair Those are the principal points about which I wished to be absolutely clear We shall now have a little supper and then retire for we may have a very busy day to morrow
A large and comfortable double bedded room had been placed at our disposal and I was quickly between the sheets for I was weary after my night of adventure Sherlock Holmes was a man however who when he had an
unsolved problem upon his mind would go for days and even for a week without rest turning it over rearranging his facts looking at it from every point of view until he had either fathomed it or convinced himself
that his data were insufficient It was soon evident to me that he was now preparing for an all night sitting He took off his coat and waistcoat put on a large blue dressing gown and then wandered about the room collecting
pillows from his bed and cushions from the sofa and armchairs With these he constructed a sort of Eastern divan upon which he perched himself cross legged with an ounce of shag tobacco and a box of matches laid out
in front of him In the dim light of the lamp I saw him sitting there an old briar pipe between his lips his eyes fixed vacantly upon the corner of the ceiling the blue smoke curling up from him silent motionless with the
light shining upon his strong set aquiline features So he sat as I dropped off to sleep and so he sat when a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up and I found the summer sun shining into the apartment The pipe was
still between his lips the smoke still curled upward and the room was full of a dense tobacco haze but nothing remained of the heap of shag which I had seen upon the previous night
Awake Watson he asked
Yes Game for a morning drive
Certainly Then dress No one is stirring yet but I know where the stable boy sleeps and we shall soon have the trap
out He chuckled to himself as he spoke his eyes twinkled and he seemed a different man to the sombre thinker of the previous night
As I dressed I glanced at my watch It was no wonder that no one was stirring It was twenty five minutes past four I had hardly finished when Holmes returned with the news that the boy was putting in the horse
I want to test a little theory of mine said he pulling on his boots I think Watson that you are now standing in the presence of one of the most absolute fools in Europe I deserve to be kicked from here to Charing
Cross But I think I have the key of the affair now And where is it I asked smiling
In the bathroom he answered Oh yes I am not joking he continued seeing my look of incredulity I have just been there and I have taken it out and I have got it in this Gladstone bag Come on my boy and we
shall see whether it will not fit the lock We made our way downstairs as quietly as possible and out into the bright morning sunshine In the road
stood our horse and trap with the half clad stable boy waiting at the head We both sprang in and away we dashed down the London Road A few country carts were stirring bearing in vegetables to the metropolis but
the lines of villas on either side were as silent and lifeless as some city in a dream
It has been in some points a singular case said Holmes flicking the horse on into a gallop I confess that I have been as blind as a mole but it is better to learn wisdom late than never to learn it at all
In town the earliest risers were just beginning to look sleepily from their windows as we drove through the streets of the Surrey side Passing down the Waterloo Bridge Road we crossed over the river and dashing up

Wellington Street wheeled sharply to the right and found ourselves in Bow Street Sherlock Holmes was well known to the force and the two constables at the door saluted him One of them held the horse s head while the
Who is on duty asked Holmes
Inspector Bradstreet sir Ah Bradstreet how are you A tall stout official had come down the stone flagged passage in a peaked
cap and frogged jacket I wish to have a quiet word with you Bradstreet Certainly Mr Holmes Step into my room here
It was a small office like room with a huge ledger upon the table and a telephone projecting from the wall
The inspector sat down at his desk
What can I do for you Mr Holmes I called about that beggarman Boone the one who was charged with being concerned in the disappearance
of Mr Neville St Clair of Lee Yes He was brought up and remanded for further inquiries
So I heard You have him here In the cells
Is he quiet Oh he gives no trouble But he is a dirty scoundrel
Dirty Yes it is all we can do to make him wash his hands and his face is as black as a tinker s Well when once his
case has been settled he will have a regular prison bath and I think if you saw him you would agree with me that he needed it
I should like to see him very much Would you That is easily done Come this way You can leave your bag
No I think that I ll take it Very good Come this way if you please He led us down a passage opened a barred door passed down a
winding stair and brought us to a whitewashed corridor with a line of doors on each side
The third on the right is his said the inspector Here it is He quietly shot back a panel in the upper part of the door and glanced through
He is asleep said he You can see him very well We both put our eyes to the grating The prisoner lay with his face towards us in a very deep sleep breathing
slowly and heavily He was a middle sized man coarsely clad as became his calling with a coloured shirt protruding through the rent in his tattered coat He was as the inspector had said extremely dirty but the grime
which covered his face could not conceal its repulsive ugliness A broad wheal from an old scar ran right across it from eye to chin and by its contraction had turned up one side of the upper lip so that three teeth were
exposed in a perpetual snarl A shock of very bright red hair grew low over his eyes and forehead
He s a beauty isn t he said the inspector
He certainly needs a wash remarked Holmes I had an idea that he might and I took the liberty of bringing the tools with me He opened the Gladstone bag as he spoke and took out to my astonishment a very large
He he You are a funny one chuckled the inspector
Now if you will have the great goodness to open that door very quietly we will soon make him cut a much more respectable figure
Well I don t know why not said the inspector He doesn t look a credit to the Bow Street cells does he He slipped his key into the lock and we all very quietly entered the cell The sleeper half turned and then settled
down once more into a deep slumber Holmes stooped to the water jug moistened his sponge and then rubbed it twice vigorously across and down the prisoner s face
Let me introduce you he shouted to Mr Neville St Clair of Lee in the county of Kent PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Never in my life have I seen such a sight The man s face peeled off under the sponge like the bark from a
tree Gone was the coarse brown tint Gone too was the horrid scar which had seamed it across and the twisted lip which had given the repulsive sneer to the face A twitch brought away the tangled red hair and there sitting
up in his bed was a pale sad faced refined looking man black haired and smooth skinned rubbing his eyes and staring about him with sleepy bewilderment Then suddenly realising the exposure he broke into a scream
and threw himself down with his face to the pillow
Great heavens cried the inspector it is indeed the missing man I know him from the photograph The prisoner turned with the reckless air of a man who abandons himself to his destiny Be it so said he
And pray what am I charged with With making away with Mr Neville St Oh come you can t be charged with that unless they make a case
of attempted suicide of it said the inspector with a grin Well I have been twenty seven years in the force but this really takes the cake
If I am Mr Neville St Clair then it is obvious that no crime has been committed and that therefore I am illegally detained
No crime but a very great error has been committed said Holmes You would have done better to have trusted your wife
It was not the wife it was the children groaned the prisoner God help me I would not have them ashamed of their father My God What an exposure What can I do
Sherlock Holmes sat down beside him on the couch and patted him kindly on the shoulder
If you leave it to a court of law to clear the matter up said he of course you can hardly avoid publicity On the other hand if you convince the police authorities that there is no possible case against you I do not know
that there is any reason that the details should find their way into the papers Inspector Bradstreet would I am sure make notes upon anything which you might tell us and submit it to the proper authorities The case would
then never go into court at all God bless you cried the prisoner passionately I would have endured imprisonment ay even execution
rather than have left my miserable secret as a family blot to my children
You are the first who have ever heard my story My father was a schoolmaster in Chesterfield where I received an excellent education I travelled in my youth took to the stage and finally became a reporter on an
evening paper in London One day my editor wished to have a series of articles upon begging in the metropolis and I volunteered to supply them There was the point from which all my adventures started It was only by
trying begging as an amateur that I could get the facts upon which to base my articles When an actor I had of course learned all the secrets of making up and had been famous in the green room for my skill I took
advantage now of my attainments I painted my face and to make myself as pitiable as possible I made a good scar and fixed one side of my lip in a twist by the aid of a small slip of flesh coloured plaster Then with a red
head of hair and an appropriate dress I took my station in the business part of the city ostensibly as a matchseller but really as a beggar For seven hours I plied my trade and when I returned home in the evening I found to my surprise that I had received no less than s d
I wrote my articles and thought little more of the matter until some time later I backed a bill for a friend and had a writ served upon me for I was at my wit s end where to get the money but a sudden idea came to me
I begged a fortnight s grace from the creditor asked for a holiday from my employers and spent the time in begging in the City under my disguise In ten days I had the money and had paid the debt
Well you can imagine how hard it was to settle down to arduous work at a week when I knew that I could earn as much in a day by smearing my face with a little paint laying my cap on the ground and sitting
still It was a long fight between my pride and the money but the dollars won at last and I threw up reporting and sat day after day in the corner which I had first chosen inspiring pity by my ghastly face and filling my
pockets with coppers Only one man knew my secret He was the keeper of a low den in which I used to lodge in Swandam Lane where I could every morning emerge as a squalid beggar and in the evenings transform myself
into a well dressed man about town This fellow a Lascar was well paid by me for his rooms so that I knew that my secret was safe in his possession
Well very soon I found that I was saving considerable sums of money I do not mean that any beggar in the streets of London could earn a year which is less than my average takings but I had exceptional
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
advantages in my power of making up and also in a facility of repartee which improved by practice and made me quite a recognised character in the City All day a stream of pennies varied by silver poured in upon me and
it was a very bad day in which I failed to take
As I grew richer I grew more ambitious took a house in the country and eventually married without anyone having a suspicion as to my real occupation My dear wife knew that I had business in the City She little knew
Last Monday I had finished for the day and was dressing in my room above the opium den when I looked out of my window and saw to my horror and astonishment that my wife was standing in the street with her eyes
fixed full upon me I gave a cry of surprise threw up my arms to cover my face and rushing to my confidant the Lascar entreated him to prevent anyone from coming up to me I heard her voice downstairs but I knew that
she could not ascend Swiftly I threw off my clothes pulled on those of a beggar and put on my pigments and wig Even a wife s eyes could not pierce so complete a disguise But then it occurred to me that there might be a
search in the room and that the clothes might betray me I threw open the window reopening by my violence a small cut which I had inflicted upon myself in the bedroom that morning Then I seized my coat which was
weighted by the coppers which I had just transferred to it from the leather bag in which I carried my takings I hurled it out of the window and it disappeared into the Thames The other clothes would have followed but at
that moment there was a rush of constables up the stair and a few minutes after I found rather I confess to my relief that instead of being identified as Mr Neville St Clair I was arrested as his murderer
I do not know that there is anything else for me to explain I was determined to preserve my disguise as long as possible and hence my preference for a dirty face Knowing that my wife would be terribly anxious I slipped
off my ring and confided it to the Lascar at a moment when no constable was watching me together with a hurried scrawl telling her that she had no cause to fear
That note only reached her yesterday said Holmes
Good God What a week she must have spent The police have watched this Lascar said Inspector Bradstreet and I can quite understand that he might
find it difficult to post a letter unobserved Probably he handed it to some sailor customer of his who forgot all about it for some days
That was it said Holmes nodding approvingly I have no doubt of it But have you never been prosecuted for begging
Many times but what was a fine to me It must stop here however said Bradstreet If the police are to hush this thing up there must be no more of
Hugh Boone I have sworn it by the most solemn oaths which a man can take
In that case I think that it is probable that no further steps may be taken But if you are found again then all must come out I am sure Mr Holmes that we are very much indebted to you for having cleared the matter up I
wish I knew how you reach your results I reached this one said my friend by sitting upon five pillows and consuming an ounce of shag I think
Watson that if we drive to Baker Street we shall just be in time for breakfast PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html VII
THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE I had called upon my friend Sherlock Holmes upon the second morning after Christmas with the intention of
wishing him the compliments of the season He was lounging upon the sofa in a purple dressing gown a piperack within his reach upon the right and a pile of crumpled morning papers evidently newly studied near at hand Beside the couch was a wooden chair and on the angle of the back hung a very seedy and disreputable
hard felt hat much the worse for wear and cracked in several places A lens and a forceps lying upon the seat of the chair suggested that the hat had been suspended in this manner for the purpose of examination
You are engaged said I perhaps I interrupt you Not at all I am glad to have a friend with whom I can discuss my results The matter is a perfectly trivial
one he jerked his thumb in the direction of the old hat but there are points in connection with it which are not entirely devoid of interest and even of instruction
I seated myself in his armchair and warmed my hands before his crackling fire for a sharp frost had set in and the windows were thick with the ice crystals I suppose I remarked that homely as it looks this thing has
some deadly story linked on to it that it is the clue which will guide you in the solution of some mystery and the punishment of some crime
No no No crime said Sherlock Holmes laughing Only one of those whimsical little incidents which will happen when you have four million human beings all jostling each other within the space of a few square miles
Amid the action and reaction of so dense a swarm of humanity every possible combination of events may be expected to take place and many a little problem will be presented which may be striking and bizarre without
being criminal We have already had experience of such So much so I remarked that of the last six cases which I have added to my notes three have been entirely
free of any legal crime Precisely You allude to my attempt to recover the Irene Adler papers to the singular case of Miss Mary
Sutherland and to the adventure of the man with the twisted lip Well I have no doubt that this small matter will fall into the same innocent category You know Peterson the commissionaire
Yes It is to him that this trophy belongs
It is his hat No no he found it Its owner is unknown I beg that you will look upon it not as a battered billycock but as
an intellectual problem And first as to how it came here It arrived upon Christmas morning in company with a good fat goose which is I have no doubt roasting at this moment in front of Peterson s fire The facts are these
about four o clock on Christmas morning Peterson who as you know is a very honest fellow was returning from some small jollification and was making his way homeward down Tottenham Court Road In front of him
he saw in the gaslight a tallish man walking with a slight stagger and carrying a white goose slung over his shoulder As he reached the corner of Goodge Street a row broke out between this stranger and a little knot of
roughs One of the latter knocked off the man s hat on which he raised his stick to defend himself and swinging it over his head smashed the shop window behind him Peterson had rushed forward to protect the stranger from
his assailants but the man shocked at having broken the window and seeing an official looking person in uniform rushing towards him dropped his goose took to his heels and vanished amid the labyrinth of small
streets which lie at the back of Tottenham Court Road The roughs had also fled at the appearance of Peterson so that he was left in possession of the field of battle and also of the spoils of victory in the shape of this battered
hat and a most unimpeachable Christmas goose Which surely he restored to their owner
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
My dear fellow there lies the problem It is true that For Mrs Henry Baker was printed upon a small card which was tied to the bird s left leg and it is also true that the initials H B are legible upon the lining of this
hat but as there are some thousands of Bakers and some hundreds of Henry Bakers in this city of ours it is not easy to restore lost property to any one of them
What then did Peterson do He brought round both hat and goose to me on Christmas morning knowing that even the smallest problems
are of interest to me The goose we retained until this morning when there were signs that in spite of the slight frost it would be well that it should be eaten without unnecessary delay Its finder has carried it off therefore to
fulfil the ultimate destiny of a goose while I continue to retain the hat of the unknown gentleman who lost his Christmas dinner
Did he not advertise No
Then what clue could you have as to his identity Only as much as we can deduce
From his hat Precisely
But you are joking What can you gather from this old battered felt Here is my lens You know my methods What can you gather yourself as to the individuality of the man who
has worn this article I took the tattered object in my hands and turned it over rather ruefully It was a very ordinary black hat of the
usual round shape hard and much the worse for wear The lining had been of red silk but was a good deal discoloured There was no maker s name but as Holmes had remarked the initials H B were scrawled upon
one side It was pierced in the brim for a hat securer but the elastic was missing For the rest it was cracked exceedingly dusty and spotted in several places although there seemed to have been some attempt to hide the
discoloured patches by smearing them with ink
I can see nothing said I handing it back to my friend
On the contrary Watson you can see everything You fail however to reason from what you see You are too timid in drawing your inferences
Then pray tell me what it is that you can infer from this hat He picked it up and gazed at it in the peculiar introspective fashion which was characteristic of him It is
perhaps less suggestive than it might have been he remarked and yet there are a few inferences which are very distinct and a few others which represent at least a strong balance of probability That the man was highly
intellectual is of course obvious upon the face of it and also that he was fairly well to do within the last three years although he has now fallen upon evil days He had foresight but has less now than formerly pointing to a
moral retrogression which when taken with the decline of his fortunes seems to indicate some evil influence probably drink at work upon him This may account also for the obvious fact that his wife has ceased to love
him My dear Holmes
He has however retained some degree of self respect he continued disregarding my remonstrance He is a man who leads a sedentary life goes out little is out of training entirely is middle aged has grizzled hair
which he has had cut within the last few days and which he anoints with lime cream These are the more patent facts which are to be deduced from his hat Also by the way that it is extremely improbable that he has gas laid
on in his house You are certainly joking Holmes
Not in the least Is it possible that even now when I give you these results you are unable to see how they are attained
I have no doubt that I am very stupid but I must confess that I am unable to follow you For example how did you deduce that this man was intellectual
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
For answer Holmes clapped the hat upon his head It came right over the forehead and settled upon the bridge of his nose It is a question of cubic capacity said he a man with so large a brain must have something in it
The decline of his fortunes then This hat is three years old These flat brims curled at the edge came in then It is a hat of the very best quality
Look at the band of ribbed silk and the excellent lining If this man could afford to buy so expensive a hat three years ago and has had no hat since then he has assuredly gone down in the world
Well that is clear enough certainly But how about the foresight and the moral retrogression Sherlock Holmes laughed Here is the foresight said he putting his finger upon the little disc and loop of the
hat securer They are never sold upon hats If this man ordered one it is a sign of a certain amount of foresight since he went out of his way to take this precaution against the wind But since we see that he has broken the
elastic and has not troubled to replace it it is obvious that he has less foresight now than formerly which is a distinct proof of a weakening nature On the other hand he has endeavoured to conceal some of these stains
upon the felt by daubing them with ink which is a sign that he has not entirely lost his self respect Your reasoning is certainly plausible
The further points that he is middle aged that his hair is grizzled that it has been recently cut and that he uses lime cream are all to be gathered from a close examination of the lower part of the lining The lens
discloses a large number of hair ends clean cut by the scissors of the barber They all appear to be adhesive and there is a distinct odour of lime cream This dust you will observe is not the gritty grey dust of the street but the
fluffy brown dust of the house showing that it has been hung up indoors most of the time while the marks of moisture upon the inside are proof positive that the wearer perspired very freely and could therefore hardly be
in the best of training But his wife you said that she had ceased to love him
This hat has not been brushed for weeks When I see you my dear Watson with a week s accumulation of dust upon your hat and when your wife allows you to go out in such a state I shall fear that you also have been
unfortunate enough to lose your wife s affection But he might be a bachelor
Nay he was bringing home the goose as a peace offering to his wife Remember the card upon the bird s leg
You have an answer to everything But how on earth do you deduce that the gas is not laid on in his house One tallow stain or even two might come by chance but when I see no less than five I think that there can
be little doubt that the individual must be brought into frequent contact with burning tallow walks upstairs at night probably with his hat in one hand and a guttering candle in the other Anyhow he never got tallow stains
from a gas jet Are you satisfied Well it is very ingenious said I laughing but since as you said just now there has been no crime
committed and no harm done save the loss of a goose all this seems to be rather a waste of energy Sherlock Holmes had opened his mouth to reply when the door flew open and Peterson the commissionaire
rushed into the apartment with flushed cheeks and the face of a man who is dazed with astonishment
The goose Mr Holmes The goose sir he gasped
Eh What of it then Has it returned to life and flapped off through the kitchen window Holmes twisted himself round upon the sofa to get a fairer view of the man s excited face
See here sir See what my wife found in its crop He held out his hand and displayed upon the centre of the palm a brilliantly scintillating blue stone rather smaller than a bean in size but of such purity and radiance that
it twinkled like an electric point in the dark hollow of his hand
Sherlock Holmes sat up with a whistle By Jove Peterson said he this is treasure trove indeed I suppose you know what you have got
A diamond sir A precious stone It cuts into glass as though it were putty It s more than a precious stone It is the precious stone
Not the Countess of Morcar s blue carbuncle I ejaculated
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Precisely so I ought to know its size and shape seeing that I have read the advertisement about it in The Times every day lately It is absolutely unique and its value can only be conjectured but the reward offered of
is certainly not within a twentieth part of the market price A thousand pounds Great Lord of mercy The commissionaire plumped down into a chair and stared from
one to the other of us
That is the reward and I have reason to know that there are sentimental considerations in the background which would induce the Countess to part with half her fortune if she could but recover the gem
It was lost if I remember aright at the Hotel Cosmopolitan I remarked
Precisely so on December nd just five days ago John Horner a plumber was accused of having abstracted it from the lady s jewel case The evidence against him was so strong that the case has been referred
to the Assizes I have some account of the matter here I believe He rummaged amid his newspapers glancing over the dates until at last he smoothed one out doubled it over and read the following paragraph
Hotel Cosmopolitan Jewel Robbery John Horner plumber was brought up upon the charge of having upon the nd inst abstracted from the jewel case of the Countess of Morcar the valuable gem known as the
blue carbuncle James Ryder upper attendant at the hotel gave his evidence to the effect that he had shown Horner up to the dressing room of the Countess of Morcar upon the day of the robbery in order that he might
solder the second bar of the grate which was loose He had remained with Horner some little time but had finally been called away On returning he found that Horner had disappeared that the bureau had been forced
open and that the small morocco casket in which as it afterwards transpired the Countess was accustomed to keep her jewel was lying empty upon the dressing table Ryder instantly gave the alarm and Horner was
arrested the same evening but the stone could not be found either upon his person or in his rooms Catherine Cusack maid to the Countess deposed to having heard Ryder s cry of dismay on discovering the robbery and to
having rushed into the room where she found matters as described by the last witness Inspector Bradstreet B division gave evidence as to the arrest of Horner who struggled frantically and protested his innocence in the
strongest terms Evidence of a previous conviction for robbery having been given against the prisoner the magistrate refused to deal summarily with the offence but referred it to the Assizes Horner who had shown
signs of intense emotion during the proceedings fainted away at the conclusion and was carried out of court Hum So much for the police court said Holmes thoughtfully tossing aside the paper The question for us
now to solve is the sequence of events leading from a rifled jewel case at one end to the crop of a goose in Tottenham Court Road at the other You see Watson our little deductions have suddenly assumed a much more
important and less innocent aspect Here is the stone the stone came from the goose and the goose came from Mr Henry Baker the gentleman with the bad hat and all the other characteristics with which I have bored you
So now we must set ourselves very seriously to finding this gentleman and ascertaining what part he has played in this little mystery To do this we must try the simplest means first and these lie undoubtedly in an
advertisement in all the evening papers If this fail I shall have recourse to other methods What will you say
Give me a pencil and that slip of paper Now then Found at the corner of Goodge Street a goose and a black felt hat Mr Henry Baker can have the same by applying at this evening at B Baker Street That
is clear and concise Very But will he see it
Well he is sure to keep an eye on the papers since to a poor man the loss was a heavy one He was clearly so scared by his mischance in breaking the window and by the approach of Peterson that he thought of nothing
but flight but since then he must have bitterly regretted the impulse which caused him to drop his bird Then again the introduction of his name will cause him to see it for everyone who knows him will direct his attention
to it Here you are Peterson run down to the advertising agency and have this put in the evening papers In which sir
Oh in the Globe Star Pall Mall St James s Gazette Evening News Standard Echo and any others that occur to you
Very well sir And this stone Ah yes I shall keep the stone Thank you And I say Peterson just buy a goose on your way back and leave
it here with me for we must have one to give to this gentleman in place of the one which your family is now PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg

When the commissionaire had gone Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light It s a bonny thing said he Just see how it glints and sparkles Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime Every good
stone is They are the devil s pet baits In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed
This stone is not yet twenty years old It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in southern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red In
spite of its youth it has already a sinister history There have been two murders a vitriol throwing a suicide and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty grain weight of crystallised charcoal Who would think
that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison I ll lock it up in my strong box now and drop a line to the Countess to say that we have it
Do you think that this man Horner is innocent I cannot tell
Well then do you imagine that this other one Henry Baker had anything to do with the matter It is I think much more likely that Henry Baker is an absolutely innocent man who had no idea that the bird
which he was carrying was of considerably more value than if it were made of solid gold That however I shall determine by a very simple test if we have an answer to our advertisement
And you can do nothing until then Nothing
In that case I shall continue my professional round But I shall come back in the evening at the hour you have mentioned for I should like to see the solution of so tangled a business
Very glad to see you I dine at seven There is a woodcock I believe By the way in view of recent occurrences perhaps I ought to ask Mrs Hudson to examine its crop
I had been delayed at a case and it was a little after half past six when I found myself in Baker Street once more As I approached the house I saw a tall man in a Scotch bonnet with a coat which was buttoned up to his
chin waiting outside in the bright semicircle which was thrown from the fanlight Just as I arrived the door was opened and we were shown up together to Holmes room
Mr Henry Baker I believe said he rising from his armchair and greeting his visitor with the easy air of geniality which he could so readily assume Pray take this chair by the fire Mr Baker It is a cold night and I
observe that your circulation is more adapted for summer than for winter Ah Watson you have just come at the right time Is that your hat Mr Baker
Yes sir that is undoubtedly my hat He was a large man with rounded shoulders a massive head and a broad intelligent face sloping down to a
pointed beard of grizzled brown A touch of red in nose and cheeks with a slight tremor of his extended hand recalled Holmes surmise as to his habits His rusty black frock coat was buttoned right up in front with the
collar turned up and his lank wrists protruded from his sleeves without a sign of cuff or shirt He spoke in a slow staccato fashion choosing his words with care and gave the impression generally of a man of learning and
letters who had had ill usage at the hands of fortune
We have retained these things for some days said Holmes because we expected to see an advertisement from you giving your address I am at a loss to know now why you did not advertise
Our visitor gave a rather shamefaced laugh Shillings have not been so plentiful with me as they once were he remarked I had no doubt that the gang of roughs who assaulted me had carried off both my hat and the bird
I did not care to spend more money in a hopeless attempt at recovering them Very naturally By the way about the bird we were compelled to eat it
To eat it Our visitor half rose from his chair in his excitement
Yes it would have been of no use to anyone had we not done so But I presume that this other goose upon the sideboard which is about the same weight and perfectly fresh will answer your purpose equally well
Oh certainly certainly answered Mr Baker with a sigh of relief
Of course we still have the feathers legs crop and so on of your own bird so if you wish PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html The man burst into a hearty laugh They might be useful to me as relics of my adventure said he but
beyond that I can hardly see what use the disjecta membra of my late acquaintance are going to be to me No sir I think that with your permission I will confine my attentions to the excellent bird which I perceive upon the
sideboard Sherlock Holmes glanced sharply across at me with a slight shrug of his shoulders
There is your hat then and there your bird said he By the way would it bore you to tell me where you got the other one from I am somewhat of a fowl fancier and I have seldom seen a better grown goose
Certainly sir said Baker who had risen and tucked his newly gained property under his arm There are a few of us who frequent the Alpha Inn near the Museum we are to be found in the Museum itself during the
day you understand This year our good host Windigate by name instituted a goose club by which on consideration of some few pence every week we were each to receive a bird at Christmas My pence were duly
paid and the rest is familiar to you I am much indebted to you sir for a Scotch bonnet is fitted neither to my years nor my gravity With a comical pomposity of manner he bowed solemnly to both of us and strode off
So much for Mr Henry Baker said Holmes when he had closed the door behind him It is quite certain that he knows nothing whatever about the matter Are you hungry Watson
Not particularly Then I suggest that we turn our dinner into a supper and follow up this clue while it is still hot
By all means It was a bitter night so we drew on our ulsters and wrapped cravats about our throats Outside the stars were
shining coldly in a cloudless sky and the breath of the passers by blew out into smoke like so many pistol shots
Our footfalls rang out crisply and loudly as we swung through the doctors quarter Wimpole Street Harley Street and so through Wigmore Street into Oxford Street In a quarter of an hour we were in Bloomsbury at the
Alpha Inn which is a small public house at the corner of one of the streets which runs down into Holborn
Holmes pushed open the door of the private bar and ordered two glasses of beer from the ruddy faced whiteaproned landlord
Your beer should be excellent if it is as good as your geese said he
My geese The man seemed surprised
Yes I was speaking only half an hour ago to Mr Henry Baker who was a member of your goose club Ah yes I see But you see sir them s not our geese
Indeed Whose then Well I got the two dozen from a salesman in Covent Garden
Indeed I know some of them Which was it Breckinridge is his name
Ah I don t know him Well here s your good health landlord and prosperity to your house Good night Now for Mr Breckinridge he continued buttoning up his coat as we came out into the frosty air
Remember Watson that though we have so homely a thing as a goose at one end of this chain we have at the other a man who will certainly get seven years penal servitude unless we can establish his innocence It is
possible that our inquiry may but confirm his guilt but in any case we have a line of investigation which has been missed by the police and which a singular chance has placed in our hands Let us follow it out to the bitter
end Faces to the south then and quick march We passed across Holborn down Endell Street and so through a zigzag of slums to Covent Garden Market
One of the largest stalls bore the name of Breckinridge upon it and the proprietor a horsey looking man with a sharp face and trim side whiskers was helping a boy to put up the shutters
Good evening It s a cold night said Holmes
The salesman nodded and shot a questioning glance at my companion
Sold out of geese I see continued Holmes pointing at the bare slabs of marble
Let you have five hundred to morrow morning That s no good
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Well there are some on the stall with the gas flare Ah but I was recommended to you
Who by The landlord of the Alpha
Oh yes I sent him a couple of dozen Fine birds they were too Now where did you get them from
To my surprise the question provoked a burst of anger from the salesman
Now then mister said he with his head cocked and his arms akimbo what are you driving at Let s have it straight now
It is straight enough I should like to know who sold you the geese which you supplied to the Alpha Well then I shan t tell you So now
Oh it is a matter of no importance but I don t know why you should be so warm over such a trifle Warm You d be as warm maybe if you were as pestered as I am When I pay good money for a good article
there should be an end of the business but it s Where are the geese and Who did you sell the geese to and What will you take for the geese One would think they were the only geese in the world to hear the fuss that
is made over them Well I have no connection with any other people who have been making inquiries said Holmes carelessly
If you won t tell us the bet is off that is all But I m always ready to back my opinion on a matter of fowls and I have a fiver on it that the bird I ate is country bred
Well then you ve lost your fiver for it s town bred snapped the salesman
It s nothing of the kind I say it is
I don t believe it D you think you know more about fowls than I who have handled them ever since I was a nipper I tell you
all those birds that went to the Alpha were town bred You ll never persuade me to believe that
Will you bet then It s merely taking your money for I know that I am right But I ll have a sovereign on with you just to teach
you not to be obstinate The salesman chuckled grimly Bring me the books Bill said he
The small boy brought round a small thin volume and a great greasy backed one laying them out together beneath the hanging lamp
Now then Mr Cocksure said the salesman I thought that I was out of geese but before I finish you ll find that there is still one left in my shop You see this little book
Well That s the list of the folk from whom I buy D you see Well then here on this page are the country folk and
the numbers after their names are where their accounts are in the big ledger Now then You see this other page in red ink Well that is a list of my town suppliers Now look at that third name Just read it out to me
Mrs Oakshott Brixton Road read Holmes
Quite so Now turn that up in the ledger Holmes turned to the page indicated Here you are Mrs Oakshott Brixton Road egg and poultry

Sherlock Holmes looked deeply chagrined He drew a sovereign from his pocket and threw it down upon the slab turning away with the air of a man whose disgust is too deep for words A few yards off he stopped under a
lamp post and laughed in the hearty noiseless fashion which was peculiar to him
When you see a man with whiskers of that cut and the Pink un protruding out of his pocket you can always draw him by a bet said he I daresay that if I had put down in front of him that man would not
have given me such complete information as was drawn from him by the idea that he was doing me on a wager
Well Watson we are I fancy nearing the end of our quest and the only point which remains to be determined is whether we should go on to this Mrs Oakshott to night or whether we should reserve it for to morrow It is
clear from what that surly fellow said that there are others besides ourselves who are anxious about the matter and I should
His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out from the stall which we had just left
Turning round we saw a little rat faced fellow standing in the centre of the circle of yellow light which was thrown by the swinging lamp while Breckinridge the salesman framed in the door of his stall was shaking his
fists fiercely at the cringing figure
I ve had enough of you and your geese he shouted I wish you were all at the devil together If you come pestering me any more with your silly talk I ll set the dog at you You bring Mrs Oakshott here and I ll answer
her but what have you to do with it Did I buy the geese off you No but one of them was mine all the same whined the little man
Well then ask Mrs Oakshott for it She told me to ask you
Well you can ask the King of Proosia for all I care I ve had enough of it Get out of this He rushed fiercely forward and the inquirer flitted away into the darkness
Ha this may save us a visit to Brixton Road whispered Holmes Come with me and we will see what is to be made of this fellow Striding through the scattered knots of people who lounged round the flaring stalls my
companion speedily overtook the little man and touched him upon the shoulder He sprang round and I could see in the gas light that every vestige of colour had been driven from his face
Who are you then What do you want he asked in a quavering voice
You will excuse me said Holmes blandly but I could not help overhearing the questions which you put to the salesman just now I think that I could be of assistance to you
You Who are you How could you know anything of the matter My name is Sherlock Holmes It is my business to know what other people don t know
But you can know nothing of this Excuse me I know everything of it You are endeavouring to trace some geese which were sold by Mrs
Oakshott of Brixton Road to a salesman named Breckinridge by him in turn to Mr Windigate of the Alpha and by him to his club of which Mr Henry Baker is a member
Oh sir you are the very man whom I have longed to meet cried the little fellow with outstretched hands and quivering fingers I can hardly explain to you how interested I am in this matter
Sherlock Holmes hailed a four wheeler which was passing In that case we had better discuss it in a cosy room rather than in this wind swept market place said he But pray tell me before we go farther who it is that
I have the pleasure of assisting The man hesitated for an instant My name is John Robinson he answered with a sidelong glance
No no the real name said Holmes sweetly It is always awkward doing business with an alias A flush sprang to the white cheeks of the stranger Well then said he my real name is James Ryder
Precisely so Head attendant at the Hotel Cosmopolitan Pray step into the cab and I shall soon be able to tell you everything which you would wish to know
The little man stood glancing from one to the other of us with half frightened half hopeful eyes as one who is not sure whether he is on the verge of a windfall or of a catastrophe Then he stepped into the cab and in half an
hour we were back in the sitting room at Baker Street Nothing had been said during our drive but the high thin PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html breathing of our new companion and the claspings and unclaspings of his hands spoke of the nervous tension
Here we are said Holmes cheerily as we filed into the room The fire looks very seasonable in this weather You look cold Mr Ryder Pray take the basket chair I will just put on my slippers before we settle this
little matter of yours Now then You want to know what became of those geese Yes sir
Or rather I fancy of that goose It was one bird I imagine in which you were interested white with a black bar across the tail
Ryder quivered with emotion Oh sir he cried can you tell me where it went to It came here
Here Yes and a most remarkable bird it proved I don t wonder that you should take an interest in it It laid an egg
after it was dead the bonniest brightest little blue egg that ever was seen I have it here in my museum Our visitor staggered to his feet and clutched the mantelpiece with his right hand Holmes unlocked his
strong box and held up the blue carbuncle which shone out like a star with a cold brilliant many pointed radiance Ryder stood glaring with a drawn face uncertain whether to claim or to disown it
The game s up Ryder said Holmes quietly Hold up man or you ll be into the fire Give him an arm back into his chair Watson He s not got blood enough to go in for felony with impunity Give him a dash of brandy
So Now he looks a little more human What a shrimp it is to be sure For a moment he had staggered and nearly fallen but the brandy brought a tinge of colour into his cheeks and
he sat staring with frightened eyes at his accuser
I have almost every link in my hands and all the proofs which I could possibly need so there is little which you need tell me Still that little may as well be cleared up to make the case complete You had heard Ryder of
this blue stone of the Countess of Morcar s It was Catherine Cusack who told me of it said he in a crackling voice
I see her ladyship s waiting maid Well the temptation of sudden wealth so easily acquired was too much for you as it has been for better men before you but you were not very scrupulous in the means you used It
seems to me Ryder that there is the making of a very pretty villain in you You knew that this man Horner the plumber had been concerned in some such matter before and that suspicion would rest the more readily upon
him What did you do then You made some small job in my lady s room you and your confederate Cusack and you managed that he should be the man sent for Then when he had left you rifled the jewel case raised the
alarm and had this unfortunate man arrested You then Ryder threw himself down suddenly upon the rug and clutched at my companion s knees For God s sake
have mercy he shrieked Think of my father Of my mother It would break their hearts I never went wrong before I never will again I swear it I ll swear it on a Bible Oh don t bring it into court For Christ s sake
don t Get back into your chair said Holmes sternly It is very well to cringe and crawl now but you thought little
enough of this poor Horner in the dock for a crime of which he knew nothing I will fly Mr Holmes I will leave the country sir Then the charge against him will break down
Hum We will talk about that And now let us hear a true account of the next act How came the stone into the goose and how came the goose into the open market Tell us the truth for there lies your only hope of safety
Ryder passed his tongue over his parched lips I will tell you it just as it happened sir said he When Horner had been arrested it seemed to me that it would be best for me to get away with the stone at once for I
did not know at what moment the police might not take it into their heads to search me and my room There was no place about the hotel where it would be safe I went out as if on some commission and I made for my sister s
house She had married a man named Oakshott and lived in Brixton Road where she fattened fowls for the market All the way there every man I met seemed to me to be a policeman or a detective and for all that it was
a cold night the sweat was pouring down my face before I came to the Brixton Road My sister asked me what was the matter and why I was so pale but I told her that I had been upset by the jewel robbery at the hotel Then
I went into the back yard and smoked a pipe and wondered what it would be best to do

I had a friend once called Maudsley who went to the bad and has just been serving his time in Pentonville
One day he had met me and fell into talk about the ways of thieves and how they could get rid of what they stole I knew that he would be true to me for I knew one or two things about him so I made up my mind to go
right on to Kilburn where he lived and take him into my confidence He would show me how to turn the stone into money But how to get to him in safety I thought of the agonies I had gone through in coming from the
hotel I might at any moment be seized and searched and there would be the stone in my waistcoat pocket I was leaning against the wall at the time and looking at the geese which were waddling about round my feet and
suddenly an idea came into my head which showed me how I could beat the best detective that ever lived
My sister had told me some weeks before that I might have the pick of her geese for a Christmas present and I knew that she was always as good as her word I would take my goose now and in it I would carry my stone to
Kilburn There was a little shed in the yard and behind this I drove one of the birds a fine big one white with a barred tail I caught it and prying its bill open I thrust the stone down its throat as far as my finger could
reach The bird gave a gulp and I felt the stone pass along its gullet and down into its crop But the creature flapped and struggled and out came my sister to know what was the matter As I turned to speak to her the brute
broke loose and fluttered off among the others
Whatever were you doing with that bird Jem says she
Well said I you said you d give me one for Christmas and I was feeling which was the fattest Oh says she we ve set yours aside for you Jem s bird we call it It s the big white one over yonder
There s twenty six of them which makes one for you and one for us and two dozen for the market Thank you Maggie says I but if it is all the same to you I d rather have that one I was handling just
now The other is a good three pound heavier said she and we fattened it expressly for you
Never mind I ll have the other and I ll take it now said I
Oh just as you like said she a little huffed Which is it you want then That white one with the barred tail right in the middle of the flock
Oh very well Kill it and take it with you Well I did what she said Mr Holmes and I carried the bird all the way to Kilburn I told my pal what I had
done for he was a man that it was easy to tell a thing like that to He laughed until he choked and we got a knife and opened the goose My heart turned to water for there was no sign of the stone and I knew that some terrible
mistake had occurred I left the bird rushed back to my sister s and hurried into the back yard There was not a bird to be seen there
Where are they all Maggie I cried
Gone to the dealer s Jem Which dealer s
Breckinridge of Covent Garden But was there another with a barred tail I asked the same as the one I chose
Yes Jem there were two barred tailed ones and I could never tell them apart Well then of course I saw it all and I ran off as hard as my feet would carry me to this man Breckinridge
but he had sold the lot at once and not one word would he tell me as to where they had gone You heard him yourselves to night Well he has always answered me like that My sister thinks that I am going mad Sometimes
I think that I am myself And now and now I am myself a branded thief without ever having touched the wealth for which I sold my character God help me God help me He burst into convulsive sobbing with his
face buried in his hands
There was a long silence broken only by his heavy breathing and by the measured tapping of Sherlock Holmes finger tips upon the edge of the table Then my friend rose and threw open the door
What sir Oh Heaven bless you No more words Get out
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
And no more words were needed There was a rush a clatter upon the stairs the bang of a door and the crisp rattle of running footfalls from the street
After all Watson said Holmes reaching up his hand for his clay pipe I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies If Horner were in danger it would be another thing but this fellow will not appear
against him and the case must collapse I suppose that I am commuting a felony but it is just possible that I am saving a soul This fellow will not go wrong again he is too terribly frightened Send him to gaol now and you
make him a gaol bird for life Besides it is the season of forgiveness Chance has put in our way a most singular and whimsical problem and its solution is its own reward If you will have the goodness to touch the bell

THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the
methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes I find many tragic some comic a large number merely strange but none commonplace for working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth he
refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual and even the fantastic Of all these varied cases however I cannot recall any which presented more singular features than that
which was associated with the well known Surrey family of the Roylotts of Stoke Moran The events in question occurred in the early days of my association with Holmes when we were sharing rooms as bachelors in Baker
Street It is possible that I might have placed them upon record before but a promise of secrecy was made at the time from which I have only been freed during the last month by the untimely death of the lady to whom the
pledge was given It is perhaps as well that the facts should now come to light for I have reasons to know that there are widespread rumours as to the death of Dr Grimesby Roylott which tend to make the matter even more
terrible than the truth
It was early in April in the year that I woke one morning to find Sherlock Holmes standing fully dressed by the side of my bed He was a late riser as a rule and as the clock on the mantelpiece showed me that it was
only a quarter past seven I blinked up at him in some surprise and perhaps just a little resentment for I was myself regular in my habits
Very sorry to knock you up Watson said he but it s the common lot this morning Mrs Hudson has been knocked up she retorted upon me and I on you
What is it then a fire No a client It seems that a young lady has arrived in a considerable state of excitement who insists upon
seeing me She is waiting now in the sitting room Now when young ladies wander about the metropolis at this hour of the morning and knock sleepy people up out of their beds I presume that it is something very pressing
which they have to communicate Should it prove to be an interesting case you would I am sure wish to follow it from the outset I thought at any rate that I should call you and give you the chance
My dear fellow I would not miss it for anything I had no keener pleasure than in following Holmes in his professional investigations and in admiring the rapid
deductions as swift as intuitions and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to
accompany my friend down to the sitting room A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled who had been sitting in the window rose as we entered
Good morning madam said Holmes cheerily My name is Sherlock Holmes This is my intimate friend and associate Dr Watson before whom you can speak as freely as before myself Ha I am glad to see that Mrs
Hudson has had the good sense to light the fire Pray draw up to it and I shall order you a cup of hot coffee for I observe that you are shivering
It is not cold which makes me shiver said the woman in a low voice changing her seat as requested
What then It is fear Mr Holmes It is terror She raised her veil as she spoke and we could see that she was indeed in a
pitiable state of agitation her face all drawn and grey with restless frightened eyes like those of some hunted animal Her features and figure were those of a woman of thirty but her hair was shot with premature grey and
her expression was weary and haggard Sherlock Holmes ran her over with one of his quick all comprehensive glances
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
You must not fear said he soothingly bending forward and patting her forearm We shall soon set matters right I have no doubt You have come in by train this morning I see
You know me then No but I observe the second half of a return ticket in the palm of your left glove You must have started early
and yet you had a good drive in a dog cart along heavy roads before you reached the station The lady gave a violent start and stared in bewilderment at my companion
There is no mystery my dear madam said he smiling The left arm of your jacket is spattered with mud in no less than seven places The marks are perfectly fresh There is no vehicle save a dog cart which throws up
mud in that way and then only when you sit on the left hand side of the driver Whatever your reasons may be you are perfectly correct said she I started from home before six reached
Leatherhead at twenty past and came in by the first train to Waterloo Sir I can stand this strain no longer I shall go mad if it continues I have no one to turn to none save only one who cares for me and he poor
fellow can be of little aid I have heard of you Mr Holmes I have heard of you from Mrs Farintosh whom you helped in the hour of her sore need It was from her that I had your address Oh sir do you not think that you
could help me too and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services but in a month or six weeks I shall be married with the
control of my own income and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful Holmes turned to his desk and unlocking it drew out a small case book which he consulted
Farintosh said he Ah yes I recall the case it was concerned with an opal tiara I think it was before your time Watson I can only say madam that I shall be happy to devote the same care to your case as I did to that of
your friend As to reward my profession is its own reward but you are at liberty to defray whatever expenses I may be put to at the time which suits you best And now I beg that you will lay before us everything that may
help us in forming an opinion upon the matter Alas replied our visitor the very horror of my situation lies in the fact that my fears are so vague and my
suspicions depend so entirely upon small points which might seem trivial to another that even he to whom of all others I have a right to look for help and advice looks upon all that I tell him about it as the fancies of a nervous
woman He does not say so but I can read it from his soothing answers and averted eyes But I have heard Mr
Holmes that you can see deeply into the manifold wickedness of the human heart You may advise me how to walk amid the dangers which encompass me
I am all attention madam My name is Helen Stoner and I am living with my stepfather who is the last survivor of one of the oldest
Saxon families in England the Roylotts of Stoke Moran on the western border of Surrey Holmes nodded his head The name is familiar to me said he
The family was at one time among the richest in England and the estates extended over the borders into Berkshire in the north and Hampshire in the west In the last century however four successive heirs were of a
dissolute and wasteful disposition and the family ruin was eventually completed by a gambler in the days of the Regency Nothing was left save a few acres of ground and the two hundred year old house which is itself
crushed under a heavy mortgage The last squire dragged out his existence there living the horrible life of an aristocratic pauper but his only son my stepfather seeing that he must adapt himself to the new conditions
obtained an advance from a relative which enabled him to take a medical degree and went out to Calcutta where by his professional skill and his force of character he established a large practice In a fit of anger
however caused by some robberies which had been perpetrated in the house he beat his native butler to death and narrowly escaped a capital sentence As it was he suffered a long term of imprisonment and afterwards
returned to England a morose and disappointed man
When Dr Roylott was in India he married my mother Mrs Stoner the young widow of Major General Stoner of the Bengal Artillery My sister Julia and I were twins and we were only two years old at the time of
my mother s re marriage She had a considerable sum of money not less than a year and this she bequeathed to Dr Roylott entirely while we resided with him with a provision that a certain annual sum should
be allowed to each of us in the event of our marriage Shortly after our return to England my mother died she was killed eight years ago in a railway accident near Crewe Dr Roylott then abandoned his attempts to establish

himself in practice in London and took us to live with him in the old ancestral house at Stoke Moran The money which my mother had left was enough for all our wants and there seemed to be no obstacle to our happiness
But a terrible change came over our stepfather about this time Instead of making friends and exchanging visits with our neighbours who had at first been overjoyed to see a Roylott of Stoke Moran back in the old
family seat he shut himself up in his house and seldom came out save to indulge in ferocious quarrels with whoever might cross his path Violence of temper approaching to mania has been hereditary in the men of the
family and in my stepfather s case it had I believe been intensified by his long residence in the tropics A series of disgraceful brawls took place two of which ended in the police court until at last he became the terror of the
village and the folks would fly at his approach for he is a man of immense strength and absolutely uncontrollable in his anger
Last week he hurled the local blacksmith over a parapet into a stream and it was only by paying over all the money which I could gather together that I was able to avert another public exposure He had no friends at all
save the wandering gipsies and he would give these vagabonds leave to encamp upon the few acres of bramblecovered land which represent the family estate and would accept in return the hospitality of their tents wandering away with them sometimes for weeks on end He has a passion also for Indian animals which are
sent over to him by a correspondent and he has at this moment a cheetah and a baboon which wander freely over his grounds and are feared by the villagers almost as much as their master
You can imagine from what I say that my poor sister Julia and I had no great pleasure in our lives No servant would stay with us and for a long time we did all the work of the house She was but thirty at the time of her
death and yet her hair had already begun to whiten even as mine has Your sister is dead then
She died just two years ago and it is of her death that I wish to speak to you You can understand that living the life which I have described we were little likely to see anyone of our own age and position We had
however an aunt my mother s maiden sister Miss Honoria Westphail who lives near Harrow and we were occasionally allowed to pay short visits at this lady s house Julia went there at Christmas two years ago and met
there a half pay major of marines to whom she became engaged My stepfather learned of the engagement when my sister returned and offered no objection to the marriage but within a fortnight of the day which had been
fixed for the wedding the terrible event occurred which has deprived me of my only companion Sherlock Holmes had been leaning back in his chair with his eyes closed and his head sunk in a cushion but
he half opened his lids now and glanced across at his visitor
Pray be precise as to details said he
It is easy for me to be so for every event of that dreadful time is seared into my memory The manor house is as I have already said very old and only one wing is now inhabited The bedrooms in this wing are on the
ground floor the sitting rooms being in the central block of the buildings Of these bedrooms the first is Dr
Roylott s the second my sister s and the third my own There is no communication between them but they all open out into the same corridor Do I make myself plain
Perfectly so The windows of the three rooms open out upon the lawn That fatal night Dr Roylott had gone to his room
early though we knew that he had not retired to rest for my sister was troubled by the smell of the strong Indian cigars which it was his custom to smoke She left her room therefore and came into mine where she sat for
some time chatting about her approaching wedding At eleven o clock she rose to leave me but she paused at the door and looked back
Tell me Helen said she have you ever heard anyone whistle in the dead of the night Never said I
I suppose that you could not possibly whistle yourself in your sleep Certainly not But why
Because during the last few nights I have always about three in the morning heard a low clear whistle I am a light sleeper and it has awakened me I cannot tell where it came from perhaps from the next room
perhaps from the lawn I thought that I would just ask you whether you had heard it No I have not It must be those wretched gipsies in the plantation
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Very likely And yet if it were on the lawn I wonder that you did not hear it also Ah but I sleep more heavily than you
Well it is of no great consequence at any rate She smiled back at me closed my door and a few moments later I heard her key turn in the lock
Indeed said Holmes Was it your custom always to lock yourselves in at night Always
And why I think that I mentioned to you that the Doctor kept a cheetah and a baboon We had no feeling of security
unless our doors were locked Quite so Pray proceed with your statement
I could not sleep that night A vague feeling of impending misfortune impressed me My sister and I you will recollect were twins and you know how subtle are the links which bind two souls which are so closely allied It
was a wild night The wind was howling outside and the rain was beating and splashing against the windows
Suddenly amid all the hubbub of the gale there burst forth the wild scream of a terrified woman I knew that it was my sister s voice I sprang from my bed wrapped a shawl round me and rushed into the corridor As I
opened my door I seemed to hear a low whistle such as my sister described and a few moments later a clanging sound as if a mass of metal had fallen As I ran down the passage my sister s door was unlocked and revolved
slowly upon its hinges I stared at it horror stricken not knowing what was about to issue from it By the light of the corridor lamp I saw my sister appear at the opening her face blanched with terror her hands groping for
help her whole figure swaying to and fro like that of a drunkard I ran to her and threw my arms round her but at that moment her knees seemed to give way and she fell to the ground She writhed as one who is in terrible
pain and her limbs were dreadfully convulsed At first I thought that she had not recognised me but as I bent over her she suddenly shrieked out in a voice which I shall never forget Oh my God Helen It was the band
The speckled band There was something else which she would fain have said and she stabbed with her finger into the air in the direction of the Doctor s room but a fresh convulsion seized her and choked her words I
rushed out calling loudly for my stepfather and I met him hastening from his room in his dressing gown When he reached my sister s side she was unconscious and though he poured brandy down her throat and sent for
medical aid from the village all efforts were in vain for she slowly sank and died without having recovered her consciousness Such was the dreadful end of my beloved sister
One moment said Holmes are you sure about this whistle and metallic sound Could you swear to it That was what the county coroner asked me at the inquiry It is my strong impression that I heard it and yet
among the crash of the gale and the creaking of an old house I may possibly have been deceived Was your sister dressed
No she was in her night dress In her right hand was found the charred stump of a match and in her left a match box
Showing that she had struck a light and looked about her when the alarm took place That is important And what conclusions did the coroner come to
He investigated the case with great care for Dr Roylott s conduct had long been notorious in the county but he was unable to find any satisfactory cause of death My evidence showed that the door had been fastened upon
the inner side and the windows were blocked by old fashioned shutters with broad iron bars which were secured every night The walls were carefully sounded and were shown to be quite solid all round and the
flooring was also thoroughly examined with the same result The chimney is wide but is barred up by four large staples It is certain therefore that my sister was quite alone when she met her end Besides there were no
marks of any violence upon her How about poison
The doctors examined her for it but without success What do you think that this unfortunate lady died of then
It is my belief that she died of pure fear and nervous shock though what it was that frightened her I cannot imagine
Were there gipsies in the plantation at the time PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Yes there are nearly always some there
Ah and what did you gather from this allusion to a band a speckled band Sometimes I have thought that it was merely the wild talk of delirium sometimes that it may have referred to
some band of people perhaps to these very gipsies in the plantation I do not know whether the spotted handkerchiefs which so many of them wear over their heads might have suggested the strange adjective which
she used Holmes shook his head like a man who is far from being satisfied
These are very deep waters said he pray go on with your narrative Two years have passed since then and my life has been until lately lonelier than ever A month ago however
a dear friend whom I have known for many years has done me the honour to ask my hand in marriage His name is Armitage Percy Armitage the second son of Mr Armitage of Crane Water near Reading My
stepfather has offered no opposition to the match and we are to be married in the course of the spring Two days ago some repairs were started in the west wing of the building and my bedroom wall has been pierced so that I
have had to move into the chamber in which my sister died and to sleep in the very bed in which she slept
Imagine then my thrill of terror when last night as I lay awake thinking over her terrible fate I suddenly heard in the silence of the night the low whistle which had been the herald of her own death I sprang up and lit the
lamp but nothing was to be seen in the room I was too shaken to go to bed again however so I dressed and as soon as it was daylight I slipped down got a dog cart at the Crown Inn which is opposite and drove to
Leatherhead from whence I have come on this morning with the one object of seeing you and asking your advice
You have done wisely said my friend But have you told me all Yes all
Miss Roylott you have not You are screening your stepfather Why what do you mean
For answer Holmes pushed back the frill of black lace which fringed the hand that lay upon our visitor s knee
Five little livid spots the marks of four fingers and a thumb were printed upon the white wrist
You have been cruelly used said Holmes
The lady coloured deeply and covered over her injured wrist He is a hard man she said and perhaps he hardly knows his own strength
There was a long silence during which Holmes leaned his chin upon his hands and stared into the crackling fire
This is a very deep business he said at last There are a thousand details which I should desire to know before I decide upon our course of action Yet we have not a moment to lose If we were to come to Stoke Moran
to day would it be possible for us to see over these rooms without the knowledge of your stepfather As it happens he spoke of coming into town to day upon some most important business It is probable that
he will be away all day and that there would be nothing to disturb you We have a housekeeper now but she is old and foolish and I could easily get her out of the way
Excellent You are not averse to this trip Watson By no means
Then we shall both come What are you going to do yourself I have one or two things which I would wish to do now that I am in town But I shall return by the twelve
o clock train so as to be there in time for your coming And you may expect us early in the afternoon I have myself some small business matters to attend to Will
you not wait and breakfast No I must go My heart is lightened already since I have confided my trouble to you I shall look forward to
seeing you again this afternoon She dropped her thick black veil over her face and glided from the room
And what do you think of it all Watson asked Sherlock Holmes leaning back in his chair
It seems to me to be a most dark and sinister business Dark enough and sinister enough
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Yet if the lady is correct in saying that the flooring and walls are sound and that the door window and chimney are impassable then her sister must have been undoubtedly alone when she met her mysterious end
What becomes then of these nocturnal whistles and what of the very peculiar words of the dying woman I cannot think
When you combine the ideas of whistles at night the presence of a band of gipsies who are on intimate terms with this old doctor the fact that we have every reason to believe that the doctor has an interest in preventing his
stepdaughter s marriage the dying allusion to a band and finally the fact that Miss Helen Stoner heard a metallic clang which might have been caused by one of those metal bars that secured the shutters falling back
into its place I think that there is good ground to think that the mystery may be cleared along those lines But what then did the gipsies do
I cannot imagine I see many objections to any such theory
And so do I It is precisely for that reason that we are going to Stoke Moran this day I want to see whether the objections are fatal or if they may be explained away But what in the name of the devil
The ejaculation had been drawn from my companion by the fact that our door had been suddenly dashed open and that a huge man had framed himself in the aperture His costume was a peculiar mixture of the professional
and of the agricultural having a black top hat a long frock coat and a pair of high gaiters with a hunting crop swinging in his hand So tall was he that his hat actually brushed the cross bar of the doorway and his breadth
seemed to span it across from side to side A large face seared with a thousand wrinkles burned yellow with the sun and marked with every evil passion was turned from one to the other of us while his deep set bile shot
eyes and his high thin fleshless nose gave him somewhat the resemblance to a fierce old bird of prey
Which of you is Holmes asked this apparition
My name sir but you have the advantage of me said my companion quietly
I am Dr Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran Indeed Doctor said Holmes blandly Pray take a seat
I will do nothing of the kind My stepdaughter has been here I have traced her What has she been saying to you
It is a little cold for the time of the year said Holmes
What has she been saying to you screamed the old man furiously
But I have heard that the crocuses promise well continued my companion imperturbably
Ha You put me off do you said our new visitor taking a step forward and shaking his hunting crop I know you you scoundrel I have heard of you before You are Holmes the meddler
Holmes the busybody His smile broadened
Holmes the Scotland Yard Jack in office Holmes chuckled heartily Your conversation is most entertaining said he When you go out close the door
for there is a decided draught I will go when I have had my say Don t you dare to meddle with my affairs I know that Miss Stoner has
been here I traced her I am a dangerous man to fall foul of See here He stepped swiftly forward seized the poker and bent it into a curve with his huge brown hands
See that you keep yourself out of my grip he snarled and hurling the twisted poker into the fireplace he strode out of the room
He seems a very amiable person said Holmes laughing I am not quite so bulky but if he had remained I might have shown him that my grip was not much more feeble than his own As he spoke he picked up the steel
poker and with a sudden effort straightened it out again
Fancy his having the insolence to confound me with the official detective force This incident gives zest to our investigation however and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from her imprudence in allowing

this brute to trace her And now Watson we shall order breakfast and afterwards I shall walk down to Doctors Commons where I hope to get some data which may help us in this matter
It was nearly one o clock when Sherlock Holmes returned from his excursion He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper scrawled over with notes and figures
I have seen the will of the deceased wife said he To determine its exact meaning I have been obliged to work out the present prices of the investments with which it is concerned The total income which at the time of
the wife s death was little short of is now through the fall in agricultural prices not more than
Each daughter can claim an income of in case of marriage It is evident therefore that if both girls had married this beauty would have had a mere pittance while even one of them would cripple him to a very serious
extent My morning s work has not been wasted since it has proved that he has the very strongest motives for standing in the way of anything of the sort And now Watson this is too serious for dawdling especially as the
old man is aware that we are interesting ourselves in his affairs so if you are ready we shall call a cab and drive to Waterloo I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket An Eley s No is
an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots That and a tooth brush are I think all that we need
At Waterloo we were fortunate in catching a train for Leatherhead where we hired a trap at the station inn and drove for four or five miles through the lovely Surrey lanes It was a perfect day with a bright sun and a few
fleecy clouds in the heavens The trees and wayside hedges were just throwing out their first green shoots and the air was full of the pleasant smell of the moist earth To me at least there was a strange contrast between the
sweet promise of the spring and this sinister quest upon which we were engaged My companion sat in the front of the trap his arms folded his hat pulled down over his eyes and his chin sunk upon his breast buried in the
deepest thought Suddenly however he started tapped me on the shoulder and pointed over the meadows
Look there said he
A heavily timbered park stretched up in a gentle slope thickening into a grove at the highest point From amid the branches there jutted out the grey gables and high roof tree of a very old mansion
Stoke Moran said he
Yes sir that be the house of Dr Grimesby Roylott remarked the driver
There is some building going on there said Holmes that is where we are going There s the village said the driver pointing to a cluster of roofs some distance to the left but if you want
to get to the house you ll find it shorter to get over this stile and so by the footpath over the fields There it is where the lady is walking
And the lady I fancy is Miss Stoner observed Holmes shading his eyes Yes I think we had better do as you suggest
We got off paid our fare and the trap rattled back on its way to Leatherhead
I thought it as well said Holmes as we climbed the stile that this fellow should think we had come here as architects or on some definite business It may stop his gossip Good afternoon Miss Stoner You see that we
have been as good as our word Our client of the morning had hurried forward to meet us with a face which spoke her joy I have been
waiting so eagerly for you she cried shaking hands with us warmly All has turned out splendidly Dr Roylott has gone to town and it is unlikely that he will be back before evening
We have had the pleasure of making the Doctor s acquaintance said Holmes and in a few words he sketched out what had occurred Miss Stoner turned white to the lips as she listened
Good heavens she cried he has followed me then So it appears
He is so cunning that I never know when I am safe from him What will he say when he returns He must guard himself for he may find that there is someone more cunning than himself upon his track You
must lock yourself up from him to night If he is violent we shall take you away to your aunt s at Harrow Now we must make the best use of our time so kindly take us at once to the rooms which we are to examine
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
The building was of grey lichen blotched stone with a high central portion and two curving wings like the claws of a crab thrown out on each side In one of these wings the windows were broken and blocked with
wooden boards while the roof was partly caved in a picture of ruin The central portion was in little better repair but the right hand block was comparatively modern and the blinds in the windows with the blue smoke
curling up from the chimneys showed that this was where the family resided Some scaffolding had been erected against the end wall and the stone work had been broken into but there were no signs of any workmen at the
moment of our visit Holmes walked slowly up and down the ill trimmed lawn and examined with deep attention the outsides of the windows
This I take it belongs to the room in which you used to sleep the centre one to your sister s and the one next to the main building to Dr Roylott s chamber
Exactly so But I am now sleeping in the middle one Pending the alterations as I understand By the way there does not seem to be any very pressing need for
repairs at that end wall There were none I believe that it was an excuse to move me from my room
Ah that is suggestive Now on the other side of this narrow wing runs the corridor from which these three rooms open There are windows in it of course
Yes but very small ones Too narrow for anyone to pass through As you both locked your doors at night your rooms were unapproachable from that side Now would you
have the kindness to go into your room and bar your shutters Miss Stoner did so and Holmes after a careful examination through the open window endeavoured in every
way to force the shutter open but without success There was no slit through which a knife could be passed to raise the bar Then with his lens he tested the hinges but they were of solid iron built firmly into the massive
masonry Hum said he scratching his chin in some perplexity my theory certainly presents some difficulties
No one could pass these shutters if they were bolted Well we shall see if the inside throws any light upon the matter
A small side door led into the whitewashed corridor from which the three bedrooms opened Holmes refused to examine the third chamber so we passed at once to the second that in which Miss Stoner was now sleeping
and in which her sister had met with her fate It was a homely little room with a low ceiling and a gaping fireplace after the fashion of old country houses A brown chest of drawers stood in one corner a narrow whitecounterpaned bed in another and a dressing table on the left hand side of the window These articles with two
small wicker work chairs made up all the furniture in the room save for a square of Wilton carpet in the centre
The boards round and the panelling of the walls were of brown worm eaten oak so old and discoloured that it may have dated from the original building of the house Holmes drew one of the chairs into a corner and sat
silent while his eyes travelled round and round and up and down taking in every detail of the apartment
Where does that bell communicate with he asked at last pointing to a thick bell rope which hung down beside the bed the tassel actually lying upon the pillow
It goes to the housekeeper s room It looks newer than the other things
Yes it was only put there a couple of years ago Your sister asked for it I suppose
No I never heard of her using it We used always to get what we wanted for ourselves Indeed it seemed unnecessary to put so nice a bell pull there You will excuse me for a few minutes while I
satisfy myself as to this floor He threw himself down upon his face with his lens in his hand and crawled swiftly backward and forward examining minutely the cracks between the boards Then he did the same with
the wood work with which the chamber was panelled Finally he walked over to the bed and spent some time in staring at it and in running his eye up and down the wall Finally he took the bell rope in his hand and gave it a
Why it s a dummy said he
Won t it ring PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html No it is not even attached to a wire This is very interesting You can see now that it is fastened to a hook just
above where the little opening for the ventilator is How very absurd I never noticed that before
Very strange muttered Holmes pulling at the rope There are one or two very singular points about this room For example what a fool a builder must be to open a ventilator into another room when with the same
trouble he might have communicated with the outside air That is also quite modern said the lady
Done about the same time as the bell rope remarked Holmes
Yes there were several little changes carried out about that time They seem to have been of a most interesting character dummy bell ropes and ventilators which do not
ventilate With your permission Miss Stoner we shall now carry our researches into the inner apartment Dr Grimesby Roylott s chamber was larger than that of his step daughter but was as plainly furnished A
camp bed a small wooden shelf full of books mostly of a technical character an armchair beside the bed a plain wooden chair against the wall a round table and a large iron safe were the principal things which met the
eye Holmes walked slowly round and examined each and all of them with the keenest interest
What s in here he asked tapping the safe
My stepfather s business papers Oh you have seen inside then
Only once some years ago I remember that it was full of papers There isn t a cat in it for example
No What a strange idea Well look at this He took up a small saucer of milk which stood on the top of it
No we don t keep a cat But there is a cheetah and a baboon Ah yes of course Well a cheetah is just a big cat and yet a saucer of milk does not go very far in satisfying
its wants I daresay There is one point which I should wish to determine He squatted down in front of the wooden chair and examined the seat of it with the greatest attention
Thank you That is quite settled said he rising and putting his lens in his pocket Hullo Here is something interesting
The object which had caught his eye was a small dog lash hung on one corner of the bed The lash however was curled upon itself and tied so as to make a loop of whipcord
What do you make of that Watson It s a common enough lash But I don t know why it should be tied
That is not quite so common is it Ah me it s a wicked world and when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all I think that I have seen enough now Miss Stoner and with your permission we shall
walk out upon the lawn I had never seen my friend s face so grim or his brow so dark as it was when we turned from the scene of this
investigation We had walked several times up and down the lawn neither Miss Stoner nor myself liking to break in upon his thoughts before he roused himself from his reverie
It is very essential Miss Stoner said he that you should absolutely follow my advice in every respect I shall most certainly do so
The matter is too serious for any hesitation Your life may depend upon your compliance I assure you that I am in your hands
In the first place both my friend and I must spend the night in your room Both Miss Stoner and I gazed at him in astonishment
Yes it must be so Let me explain I believe that that is the village inn over there Yes that is the Crown
Very good Your windows would be visible from there PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Certainly
You must confine yourself to your room on pretence of a headache when your stepfather comes back Then when you hear him retire for the night you must open the shutters of your window undo the hasp put your lamp
there as a signal to us and then withdraw quietly with everything which you are likely to want into the room which you used to occupy I have no doubt that in spite of the repairs you could manage there for one night
Oh yes easily The rest you will leave in our hands
But what will you do We shall spend the night in your room and we shall investigate the cause of this noise which has disturbed
you I believe Mr Holmes that you have already made up your mind said Miss Stoner laying her hand upon
my companion s sleeve
Perhaps I have Then for pity s sake tell me what was the cause of my sister s death
I should prefer to have clearer proofs before I speak You can at least tell me whether my own thought is correct and if she died from some sudden fright
No I do not think so I think that there was probably some more tangible cause And now Miss Stoner we must leave you for if Dr Roylott returned and saw us our journey would be in vain Good bye and be brave for
if you will do what I have told you you may rest assured that we shall soon drive away the dangers that threaten you
Sherlock Holmes and I had no difficulty in engaging a bedroom and sitting room at the Crown Inn They were on the upper floor and from our window we could command a view of the avenue gate and of the inhabited
wing of Stoke Moran Manor House At dusk we saw Dr Grimesby Roylott drive past his huge form looming up beside the little figure of the lad who drove him The boy had some slight difficulty in undoing the heavy iron
gates and we heard the hoarse roar of the Doctor s voice and saw the fury with which he shook his clinched fists at him The trap drove on and a few minutes later we saw a sudden light spring up among the trees as the lamp
was lit in one of the sitting rooms
Do you know Watson said Holmes as we sat together in the gathering darkness I have really some scruples as to taking you to night There is a distinct element of danger
Can I be of assistance Your presence might be invaluable
Then I shall certainly come It is very kind of you
You speak of danger You have evidently seen more in these rooms than was visible to me No but I fancy that I may have deduced a little more I imagine that you saw all that I did
I saw nothing remarkable save the bell rope and what purpose that could answer I confess is more than I can imagine
You saw the ventilator too Yes but I do not think that it is such a very unusual thing to have a small opening between two rooms It was
so small that a rat could hardly pass through I knew that we should find a ventilator before ever we came to Stoke Moran
My dear Holmes Oh yes I did You remember in her statement she said that her sister could smell Dr Roylott s cigar Now of
course that suggested at once that there must be a communication between the two rooms It could only be a small one or it would have been remarked upon at the coroner s inquiry I deduced a ventilator
But what harm can there be in that Well there is at least a curious coincidence of dates A ventilator is made a cord is hung and a lady who
sleeps in the bed dies Does not that strike you PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html I cannot as yet see any connection
Did you observe anything very peculiar about that bed No
It was clamped to the floor Did you ever see a bed fastened like that before I cannot say that I have
The lady could not move her bed It must always be in the same relative position to the ventilator and to the rope or so we may call it since it was clearly never meant for a bell pull
Holmes I cried I seem to see dimly what you are hinting at We are only just in time to prevent some subtle and horrible crime
Subtle enough and horrible enough When a doctor does go wrong he is the first of criminals He has nerve and he has knowledge Palmer and Pritchard were among the heads of their profession This man strikes even
deeper but I think Watson that we shall be able to strike deeper still But we shall have horrors enough before the night is over for goodness sake let us have a quiet pipe and turn our minds for a few hours to something
more cheerful About nine o clock the light among the trees was extinguished and all was dark in the direction of the Manor
House Two hours passed slowly away and then suddenly just at the stroke of eleven a single bright light shone out right in front of us
That is our signal said Holmes springing to his feet it comes from the middle window As we passed out he exchanged a few words with the landlord explaining that we were going on a late visit to
an acquaintance and that it was possible that we might spend the night there A moment later we were out on the dark road a chill wind blowing in our faces and one yellow light twinkling in front of us through the gloom to
guide us on our sombre errand
There was little difficulty in entering the grounds for unrepaired breaches gaped in the old park wall Making our way among the trees we reached the lawn crossed it and were about to enter through the window when out
from a clump of laurel bushes there darted what seemed to be a hideous and distorted child who threw itself upon the grass with writhing limbs and then ran swiftly across the lawn into the darkness
My God I whispered did you see it Holmes was for the moment as startled as I His hand closed like a vice upon my wrist in his agitation Then
he broke into a low laugh and put his lips to my ear
It is a nice household he murmured That is the baboon I had forgotten the strange pets which the Doctor affected There was a cheetah too perhaps we might find it
upon our shoulders at any moment I confess that I felt easier in my mind when after following Holmes example and slipping off my shoes I found myself inside the bedroom My companion noiselessly closed the
shutters moved the lamp onto the table and cast his eyes round the room All was as we had seen it in the daytime Then creeping up to me and making a trumpet of his hand he whispered into my ear again so gently
that it was all that I could do to distinguish the words
The least sound would be fatal to our plans I nodded to show that I had heard
We must sit without light He would see it through the ventilator I nodded again
Do not go asleep your very life may depend upon it Have your pistol ready in case we should need it I will sit on the side of the bed and you in that chair
I took out my revolver and laid it on the corner of the table
Holmes had brought up a long thin cane and this he placed upon the bed beside him By it he laid the box of matches and the stump of a candle Then he turned down the lamp and we were left in darkness
How shall I ever forget that dreadful vigil I could not hear a sound not even the drawing of a breath and yet I knew that my companion sat open eyed within a few feet of me in the same state of nervous tension in which
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I was myself The shutters cut off the least ray of light and we waited in absolute darkness
From outside came the occasional cry of a night bird and once at our very window a long drawn catlike whine which told us that the cheetah was indeed at liberty Far away we could hear the deep tones of the parish
clock which boomed out every quarter of an hour How long they seemed those quarters Twelve struck and one and two and three and still we sat waiting silently for whatever might befall
Suddenly there was the momentary gleam of a light up in the direction of the ventilator which vanished immediately but was succeeded by a strong smell of burning oil and heated metal Someone in the next room
had lit a dark lantern I heard a gentle sound of movement and then all was silent once more though the smell grew stronger For half an hour I sat with straining ears Then suddenly another sound became audible a very
gentle soothing sound like that of a small jet of steam escaping continually from a kettle The instant that we heard it Holmes sprang from the bed struck a match and lashed furiously with his cane at the bell pull
You see it Watson he yelled You see it But I saw nothing At the moment when Holmes struck the light I heard a low clear whistle but the sudden
glare flashing into my weary eyes made it impossible for me to tell what it was at which my friend lashed so savagely I could however see that his face was deadly pale and filled with horror and loathing He had ceased
to strike and was gazing up at the ventilator when suddenly there broke from the silence of the night the most horrible cry to which I have ever listened It swelled up louder and louder a hoarse yell of pain and fear and
anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek They say that away down in the village and even in the distant parsonage that cry raised the sleepers from their beds It struck cold to our hearts and I stood gazing at Holmes
and he at me until the last echoes of it had died away into the silence from which it rose
What can it mean I gasped
It means that it is all over Holmes answered And perhaps after all it is for the best Take your pistol and we will enter Dr Roylott s room
With a grave face he lit the lamp and led the way down the corridor Twice he struck at the chamber door without any reply from within Then he turned the handle and entered I at his heels with the cocked pistol in my
It was a singular sight which met our eyes On the table stood a dark lantern with the shutter half open throwing a brilliant beam of light upon the iron safe the door of which was ajar Beside this table on the
wooden chair sat Dr Grimesby Roylott clad in a long grey dressing gown his bare ankles protruding beneath and his feet thrust into red heelless Turkish slippers Across his lap lay the short stock with the long lash which
we had noticed during the day His chin was cocked upward and his eyes were fixed in a dreadful rigid stare at the corner of the ceiling Round his brow he had a peculiar yellow band with brownish speckles which seemed
to be bound tightly round his head As we entered he made neither sound nor motion
The band the speckled band whispered Holmes
I took a step forward In an instant his strange headgear began to move and there reared itself from among his hair the squat diamond shaped head and puffed neck of a loathsome serpent
It is a swamp adder cried Holmes the deadliest snake in India He has died within ten seconds of being bitten Violence does in truth recoil upon the violent and the schemer falls into the pit which he digs for
another Let us thrust this creature back into its den and we can then remove Miss Stoner to some place of shelter and let the county police know what has happened
As he spoke he drew the dog whip swiftly from the dead man s lap and throwing the noose round the reptile s neck he drew it from its horrid perch and carrying it at arm s length threw it into the iron safe which he closed
Such are the true facts of the death of Dr Grimesby Roylott of Stoke Moran It is not necessary that I should prolong a narrative which has already run to too great a length by telling how we broke the sad news to the
terrified girl how we conveyed her by the morning train to the care of her good aunt at Harrow of how the slow process of official inquiry came to the conclusion that the doctor met his fate while indiscreetly playing with a
dangerous pet The little which I had yet to learn of the case was told me by Sherlock Holmes as we travelled back next day
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I had said he come to an entirely erroneous conclusion which shows my dear Watson how dangerous it always is to reason from insufficient data The presence of the gipsies and the use of the word band which was
used by the poor girl no doubt to explain the appearance which she had caught a hurried glimpse of by the light of her match were sufficient to put me upon an entirely wrong scent I can only claim the merit that I instantly
reconsidered my position when however it became clear to me that whatever danger threatened an occupant of the room could not come either from the window or the door My attention was speedily drawn as I have already
remarked to you to this ventilator and to the bell rope which hung down to the bed The discovery that this was a dummy and that the bed was clamped to the floor instantly gave rise to the suspicion that the rope was there
as a bridge for something passing through the hole and coming to the bed The idea of a snake instantly occurred to me and when I coupled it with my knowledge that the doctor was furnished with a supply of creatures from
India I felt that I was probably on the right track The idea of using a form of poison which could not possibly be discovered by any chemical test was just such a one as would occur to a clever and ruthless man who had had
an Eastern training The rapidity with which such a poison would take effect would also from his point of view be an advantage It would be a sharp eyed coroner indeed who could distinguish the two little dark punctures
which would show where the poison fangs had done their work Then I thought of the whistle Of course he must recall the snake before the morning light revealed it to the victim He had trained it probably by the use of the
milk which we saw to return to him when summoned He would put it through this ventilator at the hour that he thought best with the certainty that it would crawl down the rope and land on the bed It might or might not bite
the occupant perhaps she might escape every night for a week but sooner or later she must fall a victim
I had come to these conclusions before ever I had entered his room An inspection of his chair showed me that he had been in the habit of standing on it which of course would be necessary in order that he should reach
the ventilator The sight of the safe the saucer of milk and the loop of whipcord were enough to finally dispel any doubts which may have remained The metallic clang heard by Miss Stoner was obviously caused by her
stepfather hastily closing the door of his safe upon its terrible occupant Having once made up my mind you know the steps which I took in order to put the matter to the proof I heard the creature hiss as I have no doubt
that you did also and I instantly lit the light and attacked it With the result of driving it through the ventilator
And also with the result of causing it to turn upon its master at the other side Some of the blows of my cane came home and roused its snakish temper so that it flew upon the first person it saw In this way I am no doubt
indirectly responsible for Dr Grimesby Roylott s death and I cannot say that it is likely to weigh very heavily upon my conscience

THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER S THUMB Of all the problems which have been submitted to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes for solution during the
years of our intimacy there were only two which I was the means of introducing to his notice that of Mr
Hatherley s thumb and that of Colonel Warburton s madness Of these the latter may have afforded a finer field for an acute and original observer but the other was so strange in its inception and so dramatic in its details that
it may be the more worthy of being placed upon record even if it gave my friend fewer openings for those deductive methods of reasoning by which he achieved such remarkable results The story has I believe been
told more than once in the newspapers but like all such narratives its effect is much less striking when set forth en bloc in a single half column of print than when the facts slowly evolve before your own eyes and the mystery
clears gradually away as each new discovery furnishes a step which leads on to the complete truth At the time the circumstances made a deep impression upon me and the lapse of two years has hardly served to weaken the
It was in the summer of not long after my marriage that the events occurred which I am now about to summarise I had returned to civil practice and had finally abandoned Holmes in his Baker Street rooms
although I continually visited him and occasionally even persuaded him to forgo his Bohemian habits so far as to come and visit us My practice had steadily increased and as I happened to live at no very great distance from
Paddington Station I got a few patients from among the officials One of these whom I had cured of a painful and lingering disease was never weary of advertising my virtues and of endeavouring to send me on every
sufferer over whom he might have any influence
One morning at a little before seven o clock I was awakened by the maid tapping at the door to announce that two men had come from Paddington and were waiting in the consulting room I dressed hurriedly for I
knew by experience that railway cases were seldom trivial and hastened downstairs As I descended my old ally the guard came out of the room and closed the door tightly behind him
I ve got him here he whispered jerking his thumb over his shoulder he s all right What is it then I asked for his manner suggested that it was some strange creature which he had caged up
It s a new patient he whispered I thought I d bring him round myself then he couldn t slip away There he is all safe and sound I must go now Doctor I have my dooties just the same as you And off he went this
trusty tout without even giving me time to thank him
I entered my consulting room and found a gentleman seated by the table He was quietly dressed in a suit of heather tweed with a soft cloth cap which he had laid down upon my books Round one of his hands he had a
handkerchief wrapped which was mottled all over with bloodstains He was young not more than five andtwenty I should say with a strong masculine face but he was exceedingly pale and gave me the impression of a man who was suffering from some strong agitation which it took all his strength of mind to control
I am sorry to knock you up so early Doctor said he but I have had a very serious accident during the night I came in by train this morning and on inquiring at Paddington as to where I might find a doctor a worthy
fellow very kindly escorted me here I gave the maid a card but I see that she has left it upon the side table I took it up and glanced at it Mr Victor Hatherley hydraulic engineer A Victoria Street rd floor That
was the name style and abode of my morning visitor I regret that I have kept you waiting said I sitting down in my library chair You are fresh from a night journey I understand which is in itself a monotonous
occupation Oh my night could not be called monotonous said he and laughed He laughed very heartily with a high
ringing note leaning back in his chair and shaking his sides All my medical instincts rose up against that laugh

Stop it I cried pull yourself together and I poured out some water from a caraffe
It was useless however He was off in one of those hysterical outbursts which come upon a strong nature when some great crisis is over and gone Presently he came to himself once more very weary and pale looking
I have been making a fool of myself he gasped
Not at all Drink this I dashed some brandy into the water and the colour began to come back to his bloodless cheeks
That s better said he And now Doctor perhaps you would kindly attend to my thumb or rather to the place where my thumb used to be
He unwound the handkerchief and held out his hand It gave even my hardened nerves a shudder to look at it
There were four protruding fingers and a horrid red spongy surface where the thumb should have been It had been hacked or torn right out from the roots
Good heavens I cried this is a terrible injury It must have bled considerably Yes it did I fainted when it was done and I think that I must have been senseless for a long time When I
came to I found that it was still bleeding so I tied one end of my handkerchief very tightly round the wrist and braced it up with a twig
Excellent You should have been a surgeon It is a question of hydraulics you see and came within my own province
This has been done said I examining the wound by a very heavy and sharp instrument A thing like a cleaver said he
An accident I presume By no means
What a murderous attack Very murderous indeed
You horrify me I sponged the wound cleaned it dressed it and finally covered it over with cotton wadding and carbolised
bandages He lay back without wincing though he bit his lip from time to time
How is that I asked when I had finished
Capital Between your brandy and your bandage I feel a new man I was very weak but I have had a good deal to go through
Perhaps you had better not speak of the matter It is evidently trying to your nerves Oh no not now I shall have to tell my tale to the police but between ourselves if it were not for the
convincing evidence of this wound of mine I should be surprised if they believed my statement for it is a very extraordinary one and I have not much in the way of proof with which to back it up and even if they believe
me the clues which I can give them are so vague that it is a question whether justice will be done Ha cried I if it is anything in the nature of a problem which you desire to see solved I should strongly
recommend you to come to my friend Mr Sherlock Holmes before you go to the official police Oh I have heard of that fellow answered my visitor and I should be very glad if he would take the matter
up though of course I must use the official police as well Would you give me an introduction to him I ll do better I ll take you round to him myself
I should be immensely obliged to you We ll call a cab and go together We shall just be in time to have a little breakfast with him Do you feel equal
to it Yes I shall not feel easy until I have told my story
Then my servant will call a cab and I shall be with you in an instant I rushed upstairs explained the matter shortly to my wife and in five minutes was inside a hansom driving with my new acquaintance to Baker Street
Sherlock Holmes was as I expected lounging about his sitting room in his dressing gown reading the agony column of The Times and smoking his before breakfast pipe which was composed of all the plugs and dottles
left from his smokes of the day before all carefully dried and collected on the corner of the mantelpiece He PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html received us in his quietly genial fashion ordered fresh rashers and eggs and joined us in a hearty meal When it
was concluded he settled our new acquaintance upon the sofa placed a pillow beneath his head and laid a glass of brandy and water within his reach
It is easy to see that your experience has been no common one Mr Hatherley said he Pray lie down there and make yourself absolutely at home Tell us what you can but stop when you are tired and keep up your
strength with a little stimulant Thank you said my patient but I have felt another man since the doctor bandaged me and I think that
your breakfast has completed the cure I shall take up as little of your valuable time as possible so I shall start at once upon my peculiar experiences
Holmes sat in his big armchair with the weary heavy lidded expression which veiled his keen and eager nature while I sat opposite to him and we listened in silence to the strange story which our visitor detailed to us
You must know said he that I am an orphan and a bachelor residing alone in lodgings in London By profession I am a hydraulic engineer and I have had considerable experience of my work during the seven years
that I was apprenticed to Venner Matheson the well known firm of Greenwich Two years ago having served my time and having also come into a fair sum of money through my poor father s death I determined to start in
business for myself and took professional chambers in Victoria Street
I suppose that everyone finds his first independent start in business a dreary experience To me it has been exceptionally so During two years I have had three consultations and one small job and that is absolutely all
that my profession has brought me My gross takings amount to s Every day from nine in the morning until four in the afternoon I waited in my little den until at last my heart began to sink and I came to believe
that I should never have any practice at all
Yesterday however just as I was thinking of leaving the office my clerk entered to say there was a gentleman waiting who wished to see me upon business He brought up a card too with the name of Colonel
Lysander Stark engraved upon it Close at his heels came the colonel himself a man rather over the middle size but of an exceeding thinness I do not think that I have ever seen so thin a man His whole face sharpened away
into nose and chin and the skin of his cheeks was drawn quite tense over his outstanding bones Yet this emaciation seemed to be his natural habit and due to no disease for his eye was bright his step brisk and his
bearing assured He was plainly but neatly dressed and his age I should judge would be nearer forty than thirty
Mr Hatherley said he with something of a German accent You have been recommended to me Mr
Hatherley as being a man who is not only proficient in his profession but is also discreet and capable of preserving a secret
I bowed feeling as flattered as any young man would at such an address May I ask who it was who gave me so good a character
Well perhaps it is better that I should not tell you that just at this moment I have it from the same source that you are both an orphan and a bachelor and are residing alone in London
That is quite correct I answered but you will excuse me if I say that I cannot see how all this bears upon my professional qualifications I understand that it was on a professional matter that you wished to speak to me
Undoubtedly so But you will find that all I say is really to the point I have a professional commission for you but absolute secrecy is quite essential absolute secrecy you understand and of course we may expect that
more from a man who is alone than from one who lives in the bosom of his family If I promise to keep a secret said I you may absolutely depend upon my doing so
He looked very hard at me as I spoke and it seemed to me that I had never seen so suspicious and questioning an eye
Do you promise then said he at last
Yes I promise Absolute and complete silence before during and after No reference to the matter at all either in word or
writing I have already given you my word
Very good He suddenly sprang up and darting like lightning across the room he flung open the door The passage outside was empty

That s all right said he coming back I know that clerks are sometimes curious as to their master s affairs
Now we can talk in safety He drew up his chair very close to mine and began to stare at me again with the same questioning and thoughtful look
A feeling of repulsion and of something akin to fear had begun to rise within me at the strange antics of this fleshless man Even my dread of losing a client could not restrain me from showing my impatience
I beg that you will state your business sir said I my time is of value Heaven forgive me for that last sentence but the words came to my lips
How would fifty guineas for a night s work suit you he asked
Most admirably I say a night s work but an hour s would be nearer the mark I simply want your opinion about a hydraulic
stamping machine which has got out of gear If you show us what is wrong we shall soon set it right ourselves
What do you think of such a commission as that The work appears to be light and the pay munificent
Precisely so We shall want you to come to night by the last train Where to
To Eyford in Berkshire It is a little place near the borders of Oxfordshire and within seven miles of Reading There is a train from Paddington which would bring you there at about
Very good I shall come down in a carriage to meet you
There is a drive then Yes our little place is quite out in the country It is a good seven miles from Eyford Station
Then we can hardly get there before midnight I suppose there would be no chance of a train back I should be compelled to stop the night
Yes we could easily give you a shake down That is very awkward Could I not come at some more convenient hour
We have judged it best that you should come late It is to recompense you for any inconvenience that we are paying to you a young and unknown man a fee which would buy an opinion from the very heads of your
profession Still of course if you would like to draw out of the business there is plenty of time to do so I thought of the fifty guineas and of how very useful they would be to me Not at all said I I shall be very
happy to accommodate myself to your wishes I should like however to understand a little more clearly what it is that you wish me to do
Quite so It is very natural that the pledge of secrecy which we have exacted from you should have aroused your curiosity I have no wish to commit you to anything without your having it all laid before you I suppose
that we are absolutely safe from eavesdroppers Entirely
Then the matter stands thus You are probably aware that fuller s earth is a valuable product and that it is only found in one or two places in England
I have heard so Some little time ago I bought a small place a very small place within ten miles of Reading I was
fortunate enough to discover that there was a deposit of fuller s earth in one of my fields On examining it however I found that this deposit was a comparatively small one and that it formed a link between two very
much larger ones upon the right and left both of them however in the grounds of my neighbours These good people were absolutely ignorant that their land contained that which was quite as valuable as a gold mine
Naturally it was to my interest to buy their land before they discovered its true value but unfortunately I had no capital by which I could do this I took a few of my friends into the secret however and they suggested that we
should quietly and secretly work our own little deposit and that in this way we should earn the money which would enable us to buy the neighbouring fields This we have now been doing for some time and in order to
help us in our operations we erected a hydraulic press This press as I have already explained has got out of order and we wish your advice upon the subject We guard our secret very jealously however and if it once

became known that we had hydraulic engineers coming to our little house it would soon rouse inquiry and then if the facts came out it would be good bye to any chance of getting these fields and carrying out our plans That
is why I have made you promise me that you will not tell a human being that you are going to Eyford to night I hope that I make it all plain
I quite follow you said I The only point which I could not quite understand was what use you could make of a hydraulic press in excavating fuller s earth which as I understand is dug out like gravel from a pit
Ah said he carelessly we have our own process We compress the earth into bricks so as to remove them without revealing what they are But that is a mere detail I have taken you fully into my confidence now Mr
Hatherley and I have shown you how I trust you He rose as he spoke I shall expect you then at Eyford at
I shall certainly be there And not a word to a soul He looked at me with a last long questioning gaze and then pressing my hand in
a cold dank grasp he hurried from the room
Well when I came to think it all over in cool blood I was very much astonished as you may both think at this sudden commission which had been intrusted to me On the one hand of course I was glad for the fee was
at least tenfold what I should have asked had I set a price upon my own services and it was possible that this order might lead to other ones On the other hand the face and manner of my patron had made an unpleasant
impression upon me and I could not think that his explanation of the fuller s earth was sufficient to explain the necessity for my coming at midnight and his extreme anxiety lest I should tell anyone of my errand However I
threw all fears to the winds ate a hearty supper drove to Paddington and started off having obeyed to the letter the injunction as to holding my tongue
At Reading I had to change not only my carriage but my station However I was in time for the last train to Eyford and I reached the little dim lit station after eleven o clock I was the only passenger who got out there
and there was no one upon the platform save a single sleepy porter with a lantern As I passed out through the wicket gate however I found my acquaintance of the morning waiting in the shadow upon the other side
Without a word he grasped my arm and hurried me into a carriage the door of which was standing open He drew up the windows on either side tapped on the wood work and away we went as fast as the horse could go
One horse interjected Holmes
Yes only one Did you observe the colour
Yes I saw it by the side lights when I was stepping into the carriage It was a chestnut Tired looking or fresh
Oh fresh and glossy Thank you I am sorry to have interrupted you Pray continue your most interesting statement
Away we went then and we drove for at least an hour Colonel Lysander Stark had said that it was only seven miles but I should think from the rate that we seemed to go and from the time that we took that it must have
been nearer twelve He sat at my side in silence all the time and I was aware more than once when I glanced in his direction that he was looking at me with great intensity The country roads seem to be not very good in that
part of the world for we lurched and jolted terribly I tried to look out of the windows to see something of where we were but they were made of frosted glass and I could make out nothing save the occasional bright blur of a
passing light Now and then I hazarded some remark to break the monotony of the journey but the colonel answered only in monosyllables and the conversation soon flagged At last however the bumping of the road
was exchanged for the crisp smoothness of a gravel drive and the carriage came to a stand Colonel Lysander Stark sprang out and as I followed after him pulled me swiftly into a porch which gaped in front of us We
stepped as it were right out of the carriage and into the hall so that I failed to catch the most fleeting glance of the front of the house The instant that I had crossed the threshold the door slammed heavily behind us and I
heard faintly the rattle of the wheels as the carriage drove away
It was pitch dark inside the house and the colonel fumbled about looking for matches and muttering under his breath Suddenly a door opened at the other end of the passage and a long golden bar of light shot out in our
direction It grew broader and a woman appeared with a lamp in her hand which she held above her head pushing her face forward and peering at us I could see that she was pretty and from the gloss with which the
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
light shone upon her dark dress I knew that it was a rich material She spoke a few words in a foreign tongue in a tone as though asking a question and when my companion answered in a gruff monosyllable she gave such a
start that the lamp nearly fell from her hand Colonel Stark went up to her whispered something in her ear and then pushing her back into the room from whence she had come he walked towards me again with the lamp in
Perhaps you will have the kindness to wait in this room for a few minutes said he throwing open another door It was a quiet little plainly furnished room with a round table in the centre on which several German
books were scattered Colonel Stark laid down the lamp on the top of a harmonium beside the door I shall not keep you waiting an instant said he and vanished into the darkness
I glanced at the books upon the table and in spite of my ignorance of German I could see that two of them were treatises on science the others being volumes of poetry Then I walked across to the window hoping that I
might catch some glimpse of the country side but an oak shutter heavily barred was folded across it It was a wonderfully silent house There was an old clock ticking loudly somewhere in the passage but otherwise
everything was deadly still A vague feeling of uneasiness began to steal over me Who were these German people and what were they doing living in this strange out of the way place And where was the place I was
ten miles or so from Eyford that was all I knew but whether north south east or west I had no idea For that matter Reading and possibly other large towns were within that radius so the place might not be so secluded
after all Yet it was quite certain from the absolute stillness that we were in the country I paced up and down the room humming a tune under my breath to keep up my spirits and feeling that I was thoroughly earning my
Suddenly without any preliminary sound in the midst of the utter stillness the door of my room swung slowly open The woman was standing in the aperture the darkness of the hall behind her the yellow light from
my lamp beating upon her eager and beautiful face I could see at a glance that she was sick with fear and the sight sent a chill to my own heart She held up one shaking finger to warn me to be silent and she shot a few
whispered words of broken English at me her eyes glancing back like those of a frightened horse into the gloom behind her
I would go said she trying hard as it seemed to me to speak calmly I would go I should not stay here
There is no good for you to do But madam said I I have not yet done what I came for I cannot possibly leave until I have seen the
machine It is not worth your while to wait she went on You can pass through the door no one hinders And then
seeing that I smiled and shook my head she suddenly threw aside her constraint and made a step forward with her hands wrung together For the love of Heaven she whispered get away from here before it is too late
But I am somewhat headstrong by nature and the more ready to engage in an affair when there is some obstacle in the way I thought of my fifty guinea fee of my wearisome journey and of the unpleasant night
which seemed to be before me Was it all to go for nothing Why should I slink away without having carried out my commission and without the payment which was my due This woman might for all I knew be a
monomaniac With a stout bearing therefore though her manner had shaken me more than I cared to confess I still shook my head and declared my intention of remaining where I was She was about to renew her entreaties
when a door slammed overhead and the sound of several footsteps was heard upon the stairs She listened for an instant threw up her hands with a despairing gesture and vanished as suddenly and as noiselessly as she had
The newcomers were Colonel Lysander Stark and a short thick man with a chinchilla beard growing out of the creases of his double chin who was introduced to me as Mr Ferguson
This is my secretary and manager said the colonel By the way I was under the impression that I left this door shut just now I fear that you have felt the draught
On the contrary said I I opened the door myself because I felt the room to be a little close He shot one of his suspicious looks at me Perhaps we had better proceed to business then said he Mr
Ferguson and I will take you up to see the machine I had better put my hat on I suppose
Oh no it is in the house PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html What you dig fuller s earth in the house
No no This is only where we compress it But never mind that All we wish you to do is to examine the machine and to let us know what is wrong with it
We went upstairs together the colonel first with the lamp the fat manager and I behind him It was a labyrinth of an old house with corridors passages narrow winding staircases and little low doors the
thresholds of which were hollowed out by the generations who had crossed them There were no carpets and no signs of any furniture above the ground floor while the plaster was peeling off the walls and the damp was
breaking through in green unhealthy blotches I tried to put on as unconcerned an air as possible but I had not forgotten the warnings of the lady even though I disregarded them and I kept a keen eye upon my two
companions Ferguson appeared to be a morose and silent man but I could see from the little that he said that he was at least a fellow countryman
Colonel Lysander Stark stopped at last before a low door which he unlocked Within was a small square room in which the three of us could hardly get at one time Ferguson remained outside and the colonel ushered
We are now said he actually within the hydraulic press and it would be a particularly unpleasant thing for us if anyone were to turn it on The ceiling of this small chamber is really the end of the descending piston and it
comes down with the force of many tons upon this metal floor There are small lateral columns of water outside which receive the force and which transmit and multiply it in the manner which is familiar to you The machine
goes readily enough but there is some stiffness in the working of it and it has lost a little of its force Perhaps you will have the goodness to look it over and to show us how we can set it right
I took the lamp from him and I examined the machine very thoroughly It was indeed a gigantic one and capable of exercising enormous pressure When I passed outside however and pressed down the levers which
controlled it I knew at once by the whishing sound that there was a slight leakage which allowed a regurgitation of water through one of the side cylinders An examination showed that one of the india rubber bands which was
round the head of a driving rod had shrunk so as not quite to fill the socket along which it worked This was clearly the cause of the loss of power and I pointed it out to my companions who followed my remarks very
carefully and asked several practical questions as to how they should proceed to set it right When I had made it clear to them I returned to the main chamber of the machine and took a good look at it to satisfy my own
curiosity It was obvious at a glance that the story of the fuller s earth was the merest fabrication for it would be absurd to suppose that so powerful an engine could be designed for so inadequate a purpose The walls were of
wood but the floor consisted of a large iron trough and when I came to examine it I could see a crust of metallic deposit all over it I had stooped and was scraping at this to see exactly what it was when I heard a muttered
exclamation in German and saw the cadaverous face of the colonel looking down at me
What are you doing there he asked
I felt angry at having been tricked by so elaborate a story as that which he had told me I was admiring your fuller s earth said I I think that I should be better able to advise you as to your machine if I knew what the
exact purpose was for which it was used The instant that I uttered the words I regretted the rashness of my speech His face set hard and a baleful
light sprang up in his grey eyes
Very well said he you shall know all about the machine He took a step backward slammed the little door and turned the key in the lock I rushed towards it and pulled at the handle but it was quite secure and did
not give in the least to my kicks and shoves Hullo I yelled Hullo Colonel Let me out And then suddenly in the silence I heard a sound which sent my heart into my mouth It was the clank of the
levers and the swish of the leaking cylinder He had set the engine at work The lamp still stood upon the floor where I had placed it when examining the trough By its light I saw that the black ceiling was coming down
upon me slowly jerkily but as none knew better than myself with a force which must within a minute grind me to a shapeless pulp I threw myself screaming against the door and dragged with my nails at the lock I
implored the colonel to let me out but the remorseless clanking of the levers drowned my cries The ceiling was only a foot or two above my head and with my hand upraised I could feel its hard rough surface Then it flashed
through my mind that the pain of my death would depend very much upon the position in which I met it If I lay on my face the weight would come upon my spine and I shuddered to think of that dreadful snap Easier the
other way perhaps and yet had I the nerve to lie and look up at that deadly black shadow wavering down upon PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html me Already I was unable to stand erect when my eye caught something which brought a gush of hope back to
I have said that though the floor and ceiling were of iron the walls were of wood As I gave a last hurried glance around I saw a thin line of yellow light between two of the boards which broadened and broadened as a
small panel was pushed backward For an instant I could hardly believe that here was indeed a door which led away from death The next instant I threw myself through and lay half fainting upon the other side The panel
had closed again behind me but the crash of the lamp and a few moments afterwards the clang of the two slabs of metal told me how narrow had been my escape
I was recalled to myself by a frantic plucking at my wrist and I found myself lying upon the stone floor of a narrow corridor while a woman bent over me and tugged at me with her left hand while she held a candle in her
right It was the same good friend whose warning I had so foolishly rejected
Come come she cried breathlessly They will be here in a moment They will see that you are not there
Oh do not waste the so precious time but come This time at least I did not scorn her advice I staggered to my feet and ran with her along the corridor and
down a winding stair The latter led to another broad passage and just as we reached it we heard the sound of running feet and the shouting of two voices one answering the other from the floor on which we were and from
the one beneath My guide stopped and looked about her like one who is at her wit s end Then she threw open a door which led into a bedroom through the window of which the moon was shining brightly
It is your only chance said she It is high but it may be that you can jump it As she spoke a light sprang into view at the further end of the passage and I saw the lean figure of Colonel
Lysander Stark rushing forward with a lantern in one hand and a weapon like a butcher s cleaver in the other I rushed across the bedroom flung open the window and looked out How quiet and sweet and wholesome the
garden looked in the moonlight and it could not be more than thirty feet down I clambered out upon the sill but I hesitated to jump until I should have heard what passed between my saviour and the ruffian who pursued me If
she were ill used then at any risks I was determined to go back to her assistance The thought had hardly flashed through my mind before he was at the door pushing his way past her but she threw her arms round him and
tried to hold him back
Fritz Fritz she cried in English remember your promise after the last time You said it should not be again He will be silent Oh he will be silent
You are mad Elise he shouted struggling to break away from her You will be the ruin of us He has seen too much Let me pass I say He dashed her to one side and rushing to the window cut at me with his heavy
weapon I had let myself go and was hanging by the hands to the sill when his blow fell I was conscious of a dull pain my grip loosened and I fell into the garden below
I was shaken but not hurt by the fall so I picked myself up and rushed off among the bushes as hard as I could run for I understood that I was far from being out of danger yet Suddenly however as I ran a deadly
dizziness and sickness came over me I glanced down at my hand which was throbbing painfully and then for the first time saw that my thumb had been cut off and that the blood was pouring from my wound I
endeavoured to tie my handkerchief round it but there came a sudden buzzing in my ears and next moment I fell in a dead faint among the rose bushes
How long I remained unconscious I cannot tell It must have been a very long time for the moon had sunk and a bright morning was breaking when I came to myself My clothes were all sodden with dew and my coatsleeve was drenched with blood from my wounded thumb The smarting of it recalled in an instant all the
particulars of my night s adventure and I sprang to my feet with the feeling that I might hardly yet be safe from my pursuers But to my astonishment when I came to look round me neither house nor garden were to be seen
I had been lying in an angle of the hedge close by the high road and just a little lower down was a long building which proved upon my approaching it to be the very station at which I had arrived upon the previous night
Were it not for the ugly wound upon my hand all that had passed during those dreadful hours might have been an evil dream
Half dazed I went into the station and asked about the morning train There would be one to Reading in less than an hour The same porter was on duty I found as had been there when I arrived I inquired of him whether
he had ever heard of Colonel Lysander Stark The name was strange to him Had he observed a carriage the night PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html before waiting for me No he had not Was there a police station anywhere near There was one about three
It was too far for me to go weak and ill as I was I determined to wait until I got back to town before telling my story to the police It was a little past six when I arrived so I went first to have my wound dressed and then
the doctor was kind enough to bring me along here I put the case into your hands and shall do exactly what you advise
We both sat in silence for some little time after listening to this extraordinary narrative Then Sherlock Holmes pulled down from the shelf one of the ponderous commonplace books in which he placed his cuttings
Here is an advertisement which will interest you said he It appeared in all the papers about a year ago
Listen to this Lost on the th inst Mr Jeremiah Hayling aged twenty six a hydraulic engineer Left his lodgings at ten o clock at night and has not been heard of since Was dressed in etc etc Ha That represents
the last time that the colonel needed to have his machine overhauled I fancy Good heavens cried my patient Then that explains what the girl said
Undoubtedly It is quite clear that the colonel was a cool and desperate man who was absolutely determined that nothing should stand in the way of his little game like those out and out pirates who will leave no survivor
from a captured ship Well every moment now is precious so if you feel equal to it we shall go down to Scotland Yard at once as a preliminary to starting for Eyford
Some three hours or so afterwards we were all in the train together bound from Reading to the little Berkshire village There were Sherlock Holmes the hydraulic engineer Inspector Bradstreet of Scotland Yard a plainclothes man and myself Bradstreet had spread an ordnance map of the county out upon the seat and was busy
with his compasses drawing a circle with Eyford for its centre
There you are said he That circle is drawn at a radius of ten miles from the village The place we want must be somewhere near that line You said ten miles I think sir
It was an hour s good drive And you think that they brought you back all that way when you were unconscious
They must have done so I have a confused memory too of having been lifted and conveyed somewhere What I cannot understand said I is why they should have spared you when they found you lying fainting
in the garden Perhaps the villain was softened by the woman s entreaties I hardly think that likely I never saw a more inexorable face in my life
Oh we shall soon clear up all that said Bradstreet Well I have drawn my circle and I only wish I knew at what point upon it the folk that we are in search of are to be found
I think I could lay my finger on it said Holmes quietly
Really now cried the inspector you have formed your opinion Come now we shall see who agrees with you I say it is south for the country is more deserted there
And I say east said my patient
I am for west remarked the plain clothes man There are several quiet little villages up there And I am for north said I because there are no hills there and our friend says that he did not notice the
carriage go up any Come cried the inspector laughing it s a very pretty diversity of opinion We have boxed the compass
among us Who do you give your casting vote to You are all wrong
But we can t all be Oh yes you can This is my point He placed his finger in the centre of the circle This is where we shall
find them But the twelve mile drive gasped Hatherley
Six out and six back Nothing simpler You say yourself that the horse was fresh and glossy when you got in
How could it be that if it had gone twelve miles over heavy roads PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Indeed it is a likely ruse enough observed Bradstreet thoughtfully Of course there can be no doubt as to
the nature of this gang None at all said Holmes They are coiners on a large scale and have used the machine to form the
amalgam which has taken the place of silver We have known for some time that a clever gang was at work said the inspector They have been turning
out half crowns by the thousand We even traced them as far as Reading but could get no farther for they had covered their traces in a way that showed that they were very old hands But now thanks to this lucky chance I
think that we have got them right enough But the inspector was mistaken for those criminals were not destined to fall into the hands of justice As we
rolled into Eyford Station we saw a gigantic column of smoke which streamed up from behind a small clump of trees in the neighbourhood and hung like an immense ostrich feather over the landscape
A house on fire asked Bradstreet as the train steamed off again on its way
Yes sir said the station master
When did it break out I hear that it was during the night sir but it has got worse and the whole place is in a blaze
Whose house is it Dr Becher s
Tell me broke in the engineer is Dr Becher a German very thin with a long sharp nose The station master laughed heartily No sir Dr Becher is an Englishman and there isn t a man in the parish
who has a better lined waistcoat But he has a gentleman staying with him a patient as I understand who is a foreigner and he looks as if a little good Berkshire beef would do him no harm
The station master had not finished his speech before we were all hastening in the direction of the fire The road topped a low hill and there was a great widespread whitewashed building in front of us spouting fire at
every chink and window while in the garden in front three fire engines were vainly striving to keep the flames under
That s it cried Hatherley in intense excitement There is the gravel drive and there are the rose bushes where I lay That second window is the one that I jumped from
Well at least said Holmes you have had your revenge upon them There can be no question that it was your oil lamp which when it was crushed in the press set fire to the wooden walls though no doubt they were
too excited in the chase after you to observe it at the time Now keep your eyes open in this crowd for your friends of last night though I very much fear that they are a good hundred miles off by now
And Holmes fears came to be realised for from that day to this no word has ever been heard either of the beautiful woman the sinister German or the morose Englishman Early that morning a peasant had met a cart
containing several people and some very bulky boxes driving rapidly in the direction of Reading but there all traces of the fugitives disappeared and even Holmes ingenuity failed ever to discover the least clue as to their
The firemen had been much perturbed at the strange arrangements which they had found within and still more so by discovering a newly severed human thumb upon a window sill of the second floor About sunset however
their efforts were at last successful and they subdued the flames but not before the roof had fallen in and the whole place been reduced to such absolute ruin that save some twisted cylinders and iron piping not a trace
remained of the machinery which had cost our unfortunate acquaintance so dearly Large masses of nickel and of tin were discovered stored in an out house but no coins were to be found which may have explained the
presence of those bulky boxes which have been already referred to
How our hydraulic engineer had been conveyed from the garden to the spot where he recovered his senses might have remained forever a mystery were it not for the soft mould which told us a very plain tale He had
evidently been carried down by two persons one of whom had remarkably small feet and the other unusually large ones On the whole it was most probable that the silent Englishman being less bold or less murderous than
his companion had assisted the woman to bear the unconscious man out of the way of danger
Well said our engineer ruefully as we took our seats to return once more to London it has been a pretty business for me I have lost my thumb and I have lost a fifty guinea fee and what have I gained

THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR The Lord St Simon marriage and its curious termination have long ceased to be a subject of interest in those
exalted circles in which the unfortunate bridegroom moves Fresh scandals have eclipsed it and their more piquant details have drawn the gossips away from this four year old drama As I have reason to believe
however that the full facts have never been revealed to the general public and as my friend Sherlock Holmes had a considerable share in clearing the matter up I feel that no memoir of him would be complete without some
little sketch of this remarkable episode
It was a few weeks before my own marriage during the days when I was still sharing rooms with Holmes in Baker Street that he came home from an afternoon stroll to find a letter on the table waiting for him I had
remained indoors all day for the weather had taken a sudden turn to rain with high autumnal winds and the jezail bullet which I had brought back in one of my limbs as a relic of my Afghan campaign throbbed with dull
persistence With my body in one easy chair and my legs upon another I had surrounded myself with a cloud of newspapers until at last saturated with the news of the day I tossed them all aside and lay listless watching the
huge crest and monogram upon the envelope upon the table and wondering lazily who my friend s noble correspondent could be
Here is a very fashionable epistle I remarked as he entered Your morning letters if I remember right were from a fish monger and a tide waiter
Yes my correspondence has certainly the charm of variety he answered smiling and the humbler are usually the more interesting This looks like one of those unwelcome social summonses which call upon a man
either to be bored or to lie He broke the seal and glanced over the contents
Oh come it may prove to be something of interest after all Not social then
No distinctly professional And from a noble client
One of the highest in England My dear fellow I congratulate you
I assure you Watson without affectation that the status of my client is a matter of less moment to me than the interest of his case It is just possible however that that also may not be wanting in this new investigation
You have been reading the papers diligently of late have you not It looks like it said I ruefully pointing to a huge bundle in the corner I have had nothing else to do
It is fortunate for you will perhaps be able to post me up I read nothing except the criminal news and the agony column The latter is always instructive But if you have followed recent events so closely you must have
read about Lord St Simon and his wedding Oh yes with the deepest interest
That is well The letter which I hold in my hand is from Lord St Simon I will read it to you and in return you must turn over these papers and let me have whatever bears upon the matter This is what he says
MY DEAR MR SHERLOCK HOLMES Lord Backwater tells me that I may place implicit reliance upon your judgment and discretion I have determined therefore to call
upon you and to consult you in reference to the very painful event which has occurred in connection with my wedding Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard is acting already in the

matter but he assures me that he sees no objection to your co operation and that he even thinks that it might be of some assistance I will call at four o clock in the afternoon and
should you have any other engagement at that time I hope that you will postpone it as this matter is of paramount importance Yours faithfully
ROBERT ST SIMON It is dated from Grosvenor Mansions written with a quill pen and the noble lord has had the misfortune to
get a smear of ink upon the outer side of his right little finger remarked Holmes as he folded up the epistle
He says four o clock It is three now He will be here in an hour Then I have just time with your assistance to get clear upon the subject Turn over those papers and arrange
the extracts in their order of time while I take a glance as to who our client is He picked a red covered volume from a line of books of reference beside the mantelpiece Here he is said he sitting down and flattening it out
upon his knee Lord Robert Walsingham de Vere St Simon second son of the Duke of Balmoral Hum
Arms Azure three caltrops in chief over a fess sable Born in He s forty one years of age which is mature for marriage Was Under Secretary for the colonies in a late administration The Duke his father was at
one time Secretary for Foreign Affairs They inherit Plantagenet blood by direct descent and Tudor on the distaff side Ha Well there is nothing very instructive in all this I think that I must turn to you Watson for something
more solid I have very little difficulty in finding what I want said I for the facts are quite recent and the matter struck
me as remarkable I feared to refer them to you however as I knew that you had an inquiry on hand and that you disliked the intrusion of other matters
Oh you mean the little problem of the Grosvenor Square furniture van That is quite cleared up now though indeed it was obvious from the first Pray give me the results of your newspaper selections
Here is the first notice which I can find It is in the personal column of the Morning Post and dates as you see some weeks back A marriage has been arranged it says and will if rumour is correct very shortly take
place between Lord Robert St Simon second son of the Duke of Balmoral and Miss Hatty Doran the only daughter of Aloysius Doran Esq of San Francisco Cal U S A That is all
Terse and to the point remarked Holmes stretching his long thin legs towards the fire
There was a paragraph amplifying this in one of the society papers of the same week Ah here it is There will soon be a call for protection in the marriage market for the present free trade principle appears to tell
heavily against our home product One by one the management of the noble houses of Great Britain is passing into the hands of our fair cousins from across the Atlantic An important addition has been made during the last
week to the list of the prizes which have been borne away by these charming invaders Lord St Simon who has shown himself for over twenty years proof against the little god s arrows has now definitely announced his
approaching marriage with Miss Hatty Doran the fascinating daughter of a California millionaire Miss Doran whose graceful figure and striking face attracted much attention at the Westbury House festivities is an only
child and it is currently reported that her dowry will run to considerably over the six figures with expectancies for the future As it is an open secret that the Duke of Balmoral has been compelled to sell his pictures within the
last few years and as Lord St Simon has no property of his own save the small estate of Birchmoor it is obvious that the Californian heiress is not the only gainer by an alliance which will enable her to make the easy and
common transition from a Republican lady to a British peeress Anything else asked Holmes yawning
Oh yes plenty Then there is another note in the Morning Post to say that the marriage would be an absolutely quiet one that it would be at St George s Hanover Square that only half a dozen intimate friends
would be invited and that the party would return to the furnished house at Lancaster Gate which has been taken by Mr Aloysius Doran Two days later that is on Wednesday last there is a curt announcement that the
wedding had taken place and that the honeymoon would be passed at Lord Backwater s place near Petersfield
Those are all the notices which appeared before the disappearance of the bride Before the what asked Holmes with a start
The vanishing of the lady PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html When did she vanish then
At the wedding breakfast Indeed This is more interesting than it promised to be quite dramatic in fact
Yes it struck me as being a little out of the common They often vanish before the ceremony and occasionally during the honeymoon but I cannot call to mind
anything quite so prompt as this Pray let me have the details I warn you that they are very incomplete
Perhaps we may make them less so Such as they are they are set forth in a single article of a morning paper of yesterday which I will read to
you It is headed Singular Occurrence at a Fashionable Wedding
The family of Lord Robert St Simon has been thrown into the greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have taken place in connection with his wedding The ceremony as shortly announced in
the papers of yesterday occurred on the previous morning but it is only now that it has been possible to confirm the strange rumours which have been so persistently floating about In spite of the attempts of the friends to hush
the matter up so much public attention has now been drawn to it that no good purpose can be served by affecting to disregard what is a common subject for conversation
The ceremony which was performed at St George s Hanover Square was a very quiet one no one being present save the father of the bride Mr Aloysius Doran the Duchess of Balmoral Lord Backwater Lord
Eustace and Lady Clara St Simon the younger brother and sister of the bridegroom and Lady Alicia Whittington The whole party proceeded afterwards to the house of Mr Aloysius Doran at Lancaster Gate
where breakfast had been prepared It appears that some little trouble was caused by a woman whose name has not been ascertained who endeavoured to force her way into the house after the bridal party alleging that she
had some claim upon Lord St Simon It was only after a painful and prolonged scene that she was ejected by the butler and the footman The bride who had fortunately entered the house before this unpleasant interruption had
sat down to breakfast with the rest when she complained of a sudden indisposition and retired to her room Her prolonged absence having caused some comment her father followed her but learned from her maid that she
had only come up to her chamber for an instant caught up an ulster and bonnet and hurried down to the passage One of the footmen declared that he had seen a lady leave the house thus apparelled but had refused to
credit that it was his mistress believing her to be with the company On ascertaining that his daughter had disappeared Mr Aloysius Doran in conjunction with the bridegroom instantly put themselves in
communication with the police and very energetic inquiries are being made which will probably result in a speedy clearing up of this very singular business Up to a late hour last night however nothing had transpired as
to the whereabouts of the missing lady There are rumours of foul play in the matter and it is said that the police have caused the arrest of the woman who had caused the original disturbance in the belief that from jealousy or
some other motive she may have been concerned in the strange disappearance of the bride And is that all
Only one little item in another of the morning papers but it is a suggestive one And it is
That Miss Flora Millar the lady who had caused the disturbance has actually been arrested It appears that she was formerly a danseuse at the Allegro and that she has known the bridegroom for some years There are no
further particulars and the whole case is in your hands now so far as it has been set forth in the public press And an exceedingly interesting case it appears to be I would not have missed it for worlds But there is a
ring at the bell Watson and as the clock makes it a few minutes after four I have no doubt that this will prove to be our noble client Do not dream of going Watson for I very much prefer having a witness if only as a check
to my own memory Lord Robert St Simon announced our page boy throwing open the door A gentleman entered with a
pleasant cultured face high nosed and pale with something perhaps of petulance about the mouth and with the steady well opened eye of a man whose pleasant lot it had ever been to command and to be obeyed His manner
was brisk and yet his general appearance gave an undue impression of age for he had a slight forward stoop and a little bend of the knees as he walked His hair too as he swept off his very curly brimmed hat was grizzled
round the edges and thin upon the top As to his dress it was careful to the verge of foppishness with high PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html collar black frock coat white waistcoat yellow gloves patent leather shoes and light coloured gaiters He
advanced slowly into the room turning his head from left to right and swinging in his right hand the cord which held his golden eyeglasses
Good day Lord St Simon said Holmes rising and bowing Pray take the basket chair This is my friend and colleague Dr Watson Draw up a little to the fire and we will talk this matter over
A most painful matter to me as you can most readily imagine Mr Holmes I have been cut to the quick I understand that you have already managed several delicate cases of this sort sir though I presume that they were
hardly from the same class of society No I am descending
I beg pardon My last client of the sort was a king
Oh really I had no idea And which king The King of Scandinavia
What Had he lost his wife You can understand said Holmes suavely that I extend to the affairs of my other clients the same secrecy
which I promise to you in yours Of course Very right very right I m sure I beg pardon As to my own case I am ready to give you any
information which may assist you in forming an opinion Thank you I have already learned all that is in the public prints nothing more I presume that I may take it as
correct this article for example as to the disappearance of the bride Lord St Simon glanced over it Yes it is correct as far as it goes
But it needs a great deal of supplementing before anyone could offer an opinion I think that I may arrive at my facts most directly by questioning you
Pray do so When did you first meet Miss Hatty Doran
In San Francisco a year ago You were travelling in the States
Yes Did you become engaged then
No But you were on a friendly footing
I was amused by her society and she could see that I was amused Her father is very rich
He is said to be the richest man on the Pacific slope And how did he make his money
In mining He had nothing a few years ago Then he struck gold invested it and came up by leaps and bounds
Now what is your own impression as to the young lady s your wife s character The nobleman swung his glasses a little faster and stared down into the fire You see Mr Holmes said he
my wife was twenty before her father became a rich man During that time she ran free in a mining camp and wandered through woods or mountains so that her education has come from Nature rather than from the
schoolmaster She is what we call in England a tomboy with a strong nature wild and free unfettered by any sort of traditions She is impetuous volcanic I was about to say She is swift in making up her mind and
fearless in carrying out her resolutions On the other hand I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to bear he gave a little stately cough had I not thought her to be at bottom a noble woman I believe
that she is capable of heroic self sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to her Have you her photograph
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I brought this with me He opened a locket and showed us the full face of a very lovely woman It was not a photograph but an ivory miniature and the artist had brought out the full effect of the lustrous black hair the
large dark eyes and the exquisite mouth Holmes gazed long and earnestly at it Then he closed the locket and handed it back to Lord St Simon
The young lady came to London then and you renewed your acquaintance Yes her father brought her over for this last London season I met her several times became engaged to her
and have now married her She brought I understand a considerable dowry
A fair dowry Not more than is usual in my family And this of course remains to you since the marriage is a fait accompli
I really have made no inquiries on the subject Very naturally not Did you see Miss Doran on the day before the wedding
Yes Was she in good spirits
Never better She kept talking of what we should do in our future lives Indeed That is very interesting And on the morning of the wedding
She was as bright as possible at least until after the ceremony And did you observe any change in her then
Well to tell the truth I saw then the first signs that I had ever seen that her temper was just a little sharp The incident however was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the case
Pray let us have it for all that Oh it is childish She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the vestry She was passing the front pew at
the time and it fell over into the pew There was a moment s delay but the gentleman in the pew handed it up to her again and it did not appear to be the worse for the fall Yet when I spoke to her of the matter she answered
me abruptly and in the carriage on our way home she seemed absurdly agitated over this trifling cause Indeed You say that there was a gentleman in the pew Some of the general public were present then
Oh yes It is impossible to exclude them when the church is open This gentleman was not one of your wife s friends
No no I call him a gentleman by courtesy but he was quite a common looking person I hardly noticed his appearance But really I think that we are wandering rather far from the point
Lady St Simon then returned from the wedding in a less cheerful frame of mind than she had gone to it
What did she do on re entering her father s house I saw her in conversation with her maid
And who is her maid Alice is her name She is an American and came from California with her
A confidential servant A little too much so It seemed to me that her mistress allowed her to take great liberties Still of course in
America they look upon these things in a different way How long did she speak to this Alice
Oh a few minutes I had something else to think of You did not overhear what they said
Lady St Simon said something about jumping a claim She was accustomed to use slang of the kind I have no idea what she meant
American slang is very expressive sometimes And what did your wife do when she finished speaking to her maid
She walked into the breakfast room On your arm
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
No alone She was very independent in little matters like that Then after we had sat down for ten minutes or so she rose hurriedly muttered some words of apology and left the room She never came back
But this maid Alice as I understand deposes that she went to her room covered her bride s dress with a long ulster put on a bonnet and went out
Quite so And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in company with Flora Millar a woman who is now in custody and who had already made a disturbance at Mr Doran s house that morning
Ah yes I should like a few particulars as to this young lady and your relations to her Lord St Simon shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows We have been on a friendly footing for some
years I may say on a very friendly footing She used to be at the Allegro I have not treated her ungenerously and she had no just cause of complaint against me but you know what women are Mr Holmes Flora was a dear
little thing but exceedingly hot headed and devotedly attached to me She wrote me dreadful letters when she heard that I was about to be married and to tell the truth the reason why I had the marriage celebrated so
quietly was that I feared lest there might be a scandal in the church She came to Mr Doran s door just after we returned and she endeavoured to push her way in uttering very abusive expressions towards my wife and even
threatening her but I had foreseen the possibility of something of the sort and I had two police fellows there in private clothes who soon pushed her out again She was quiet when she saw that there was no good in making a
row Did your wife hear all this
No thank goodness she did not And she was seen walking with this very woman afterwards
Yes That is what Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard looks upon as so serious It is thought that Flora decoyed my wife out and laid some terrible trap for her
Well it is a possible supposition You think so too
I did not say a probable one But you do not yourself look upon this as likely I do not think Flora would hurt a fly
Still jealousy is a strange transformer of characters Pray what is your own theory as to what took place Well really I came to seek a theory not to propound one I have given you all the facts Since you ask me
however I may say that it has occurred to me as possible that the excitement of this affair the consciousness that she had made so immense a social stride had the effect of causing some little nervous disturbance in my wife
In short that she had become suddenly deranged Well really when I consider that she has turned her back I will not say upon me but upon so much that
many have aspired to without success I can hardly explain it in any other fashion Well certainly that is also a conceivable hypothesis said Holmes smiling And now Lord St Simon I
think that I have nearly all my data May I ask whether you were seated at the breakfast table so that you could see out of the window
We could see the other side of the road and the Park Quite so Then I do not think that I need to detain you longer I shall communicate with you
Should you be fortunate enough to solve this problem said our client rising
I have solved it Eh What was that
I say that I have solved it Where then is my wife
That is a detail which I shall speedily supply Lord St Simon shook his head I am afraid that it will take wiser heads than yours or mine he remarked
and bowing in a stately old fashioned manner he departed
It is very good of Lord St Simon to honour my head by putting it on a level with his own said Sherlock Holmes laughing I think that I shall have a whisky and soda and a cigar after all this cross questioning I had
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
formed my conclusions as to the case before our client came into the room My dear Holmes
I have notes of several similar cases though none as I remarked before which were quite as prompt My whole examination served to turn my conjecture into a certainty Circumstantial evidence is occasionally very
convincing as when you find a trout in the milk to quote Thoreau s example But I have heard all that you have heard
Without however the knowledge of pre existing cases which serves me so well There was a parallel instance in Aberdeen some years back and something on very much the same lines at Munich the year after the
Franco Prussian War It is one of these cases but hullo here is Lestrade Good afternoon Lestrade You will find an extra tumbler upon the sideboard and there are cigars in the box
The official detective was attired in a pea jacket and cravat which gave him a decidedly nautical appearance and he carried a black canvas bag in his hand With a short greeting he seated himself and lit the cigar which had
been offered to him
What s up then asked Holmes with a twinkle in his eye You look dissatisfied And I feel dissatisfied It is this infernal St Simon marriage case I can make neither head nor tail of the
business Really You surprise me
Who ever heard of such a mixed affair Every clue seems to slip through my fingers I have been at work upon it all day
And very wet it seems to have made you said Holmes laying his hand upon the arm of the pea jacket
Yes I have been dragging the Serpentine In Heaven s name what for
In search of the body of Lady St Simon Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair and laughed heartily
Have you dragged the basin of Trafalgar Square fountain he asked
Why What do you mean Because you have just as good a chance of finding this lady in the one as in the other
Lestrade shot an angry glance at my companion I suppose you know all about it he snarled
Well I have only just heard the facts but my mind is made up Oh indeed Then you think that the Serpentine plays no part in the matter
I think it very unlikely Then perhaps you will kindly explain how it is that we found this in it He opened his bag as he spoke and
tumbled onto the floor a wedding dress of watered silk a pair of white satin shoes and a bride s wreath and veil all discoloured and soaked in water There said he putting a new wedding ring upon the top of the pile
There is a little nut for you to crack Master Holmes Oh indeed said my friend blowing blue rings into the air You dragged them from the Serpentine
No They were found floating near the margin by a park keeper They have been identified as her clothes and it seemed to me that if the clothes were there the body would not be far off
By the same brilliant reasoning every man s body is to be found in the neighbourhood of his wardrobe And pray what did you hope to arrive at through this
At some evidence implicating Flora Millar in the disappearance I am afraid that you will find it difficult
Are you indeed now cried Lestrade with some bitterness I am afraid Holmes that you are not very practical with your deductions and your inferences You have made two blunders in as many minutes This dress
does implicate Miss Flora Millar And how
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
In the dress is a pocket In the pocket is a card case In the card case is a note And here is the very note He slapped it down upon the table in front of him Listen to this You will see me when all is ready Come at once
F H M Now my theory all along has been that Lady St Simon was decoyed away by Flora Millar and that she with confederates no doubt was responsible for her disappearance Here signed with her initials is the
very note which was no doubt quietly slipped into her hand at the door and which lured her within their reach Very good Lestrade said Holmes laughing You really are very fine indeed Let me see it He took up the
paper in a listless way but his attention instantly became riveted and he gave a little cry of satisfaction This is indeed important said he
Ha you find it so Extremely so I congratulate you warmly
Lestrade rose in his triumph and bent his head to look Why he shrieked you re looking at the wrong side
On the contrary this is the right side The right side You re mad Here is the note written in pencil over here
And over here is what appears to be the fragment of a hotel bill which interests me deeply There s nothing in it I looked at it before said Lestrade Oct th rooms s breakfast s d cocktail
s lunch s d glass sherry d I see nothing in that Very likely not It is most important all the same As to the note it is important also or at least the initials
are so I congratulate you again I ve wasted time enough said Lestrade rising I believe in hard work and not in sitting by the fire spinning
fine theories Good day Mr Holmes and we shall see which gets to the bottom of the matter first He gathered up the garments thrust them into the bag and made for the door
Just one hint to you Lestrade drawled Holmes before his rival vanished I will tell you the true solution of the matter Lady St Simon is a myth There is not and there never has been any such person
Lestrade looked sadly at my companion Then he turned to me tapped his forehead three times shook his head solemnly and hurried away
He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his overcoat There is something in what the fellow says about outdoor work he remarked so I think Watson that I must leave you to your papers
for a little It was after five o clock when Sherlock Holmes left me but I had no time to be lonely for within an hour
there arrived a confectioner s man with a very large flat box This he unpacked with the help of a youth whom he had brought with him and presently to my very great astonishment a quite epicurean little cold supper began to
be laid out upon our humble lodging house mahogany There were a couple of brace of cold woodcock a pheasant a p t de foie gras pie with a group of ancient and cobwebby bottles Having laid out all these
luxuries my two visitors vanished away like the genii of the Arabian Nights with no explanation save that the things had been paid for and were ordered to this address
Just before nine o clock Sherlock Holmes stepped briskly into the room His features were gravely set but there was a light in his eye which made me think that he had not been disappointed in his conclusions
They have laid the supper then he said rubbing his hands
You seem to expect company They have laid for five Yes I fancy we may have some company dropping in said he I am surprised that Lord St Simon has not
already arrived Ha I fancy that I hear his step now upon the stairs It was indeed our visitor of the afternoon who came bustling in dangling his glasses more vigorously than
ever and with a very perturbed expression upon his aristocratic features
My messenger reached you then asked Holmes
Yes and I confess that the contents startled me beyond measure Have you good authority for what you say The best possible
Lord St Simon sank into a chair and passed his hand over his forehead
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
What will the Duke say he murmured when he hears that one of the family has been subjected to such humiliation
It is the purest accident I cannot allow that there is any humiliation Ah you look on these things from another standpoint
I fail to see that anyone is to blame I can hardly see how the lady could have acted otherwise though her abrupt method of doing it was undoubtedly to be regretted Having no mother she had no one to advise her at
such a crisis It was a slight sir a public slight said Lord St Simon tapping his fingers upon the table
You must make allowance for this poor girl placed in so unprecedented a position I will make no allowance I am very angry indeed and I have been shamefully used
I think that I heard a ring said Holmes Yes there are steps on the landing If I cannot persuade you to take a lenient view of the matter Lord St Simon I have brought an advocate here who may be more successful He
opened the door and ushered in a lady and gentleman Lord St Simon said he allow me to introduce you to Mr and Mrs Francis Hay Moulton The lady I think you have already met
At the sight of these newcomers our client had sprung from his seat and stood very erect with his eyes cast down and his hand thrust into the breast of his frock coat a picture of offended dignity The lady had taken a
quick step forward and had held out her hand to him but he still refused to raise his eyes It was as well for his resolution perhaps for her pleading face was one which it was hard to resist
You re angry Robert said she Well I guess you have every cause to be Pray make no apology to me said Lord St Simon bitterly
Oh yes I know that I have treated you real bad and that I should have spoken to you before I went but I was kind of rattled and from the time when I saw Frank here again I just didn t know what I was doing or saying I
only wonder I didn t fall down and do a faint right there before the altar Perhaps Mrs Moulton you would like my friend and me to leave the room while you explain this matter
If I may give an opinion remarked the strange gentleman we ve had just a little too much secrecy over this business already For my part I should like all Europe and America to hear the rights of it He was a small
wiry sunburnt man clean shaven with a sharp face and alert manner
Then I ll tell our story right away said the lady Frank here and I met in in Mc Quire s camp near the Rockies where Pa was working a claim We were engaged to each other Frank and I but then one day father
struck a rich pocket and made a pile while poor Frank here had a claim that petered out and came to nothing
The richer Pa grew the poorer was Frank so at last Pa wouldn t hear of our engagement lasting any longer and he took me away to Frisco Frank wouldn t throw up his hand though so he followed me there and he saw me
without Pa knowing anything about it It would only have made him mad to know so we just fixed it all up for ourselves Frank said that he would go and make his pile too and never come back to claim me until he had as
much as Pa So then I promised to wait for him to the end of time and pledged myself not to marry anyone else while he lived Why shouldn t we be married right away then said he and then I will feel sure of you and I
won t claim to be your husband until I come back Well we talked it over and he had fixed it all up so nicely with a clergyman all ready in waiting that we just did it right there and then Frank went off to seek his fortune
and I went back to Pa
The next I heard of Frank was that he was in Montana and then he went prospecting in Arizona and then I heard of him from New Mexico After that came a long newspaper story about how a miners camp had been
attacked by Apache Indians and there was my Frank s name among the killed I fainted dead away and I was very sick for months after Pa thought I had a decline and took me to half the doctors in Frisco Not a word of
news came for a year and more so that I never doubted that Frank was really dead Then Lord St Simon came to Frisco and we came to London and a marriage was arranged and Pa was very pleased but I felt all the time
that no man on this earth would ever take the place in my heart that had been given to my poor Frank
Still if I had married Lord St Simon of course I d have done my duty by him We can t command our love but we can our actions I went to the altar with him with the intention to make him just as good a wife as it was
in me to be But you may imagine what I felt when just as I came to the altar rails I glanced back and saw Frank standing and looking at me out of the first pew I thought it was his ghost at first but when I looked again there

he was still with a kind of question in his eyes as if to ask me whether I were glad or sorry to see him I wonder I didn t drop I know that everything was turning round and the words of the clergyman were just like the buzz
of a bee in my ear I didn t know what to do Should I stop the service and make a scene in the church I glanced at him again and he seemed to know what I was thinking for he raised his finger to his lips to tell me to be still
Then I saw him scribble on a piece of paper and I knew that he was writing me a note As I passed his pew on the way out I dropped my bouquet over to him and he slipped the note into my hand when he returned me the
flowers It was only a line asking me to join him when he made the sign to me to do so Of course I never doubted for a moment that my first duty was now to him and I determined to do just whatever he might direct
When I got back I told my maid who had known him in California and had always been his friend I ordered her to say nothing but to get a few things packed and my ulster ready I know I ought to have spoken to Lord St
Simon but it was dreadful hard before his mother and all those great people I just made up my mind to run away and explain afterwards I hadn t been at the table ten minutes before I saw Frank out of the window at the
other side of the road He beckoned to me and then began walking into the Park I slipped out put on my things and followed him Some woman came talking something or other about Lord St Simon to me seemed to me
from the little I heard as if he had a little secret of his own before marriage also but I managed to get away from her and soon overtook Frank We got into a cab together and away we drove to some lodgings he had taken
in Gordon Square and that was my true wedding after all those years of waiting Frank had been a prisoner among the Apaches had escaped came on to Frisco found that I had given him up for dead and had gone to
England followed me there and had come upon me at last on the very morning of my second wedding I saw it in a paper explained the American It gave the name and the church but not where the lady lived
Then we had a talk as to what we should do and Frank was all for openness but I was so ashamed of it all that I felt as if I should like to vanish away and never see any of them again just sending a line to Pa perhaps
to show him that I was alive It was awful to me to think of all those lords and ladies sitting round that breakfasttable and waiting for me to come back So Frank took my wedding clothes and things and made a bundle of them so that I should not be traced and dropped them away somewhere where no one could find them It is
likely that we should have gone on to Paris to morrow only that this good gentleman Mr Holmes came round to us this evening though how he found us is more than I can think and he showed us very clearly and kindly
that I was wrong and that Frank was right and that we should be putting ourselves in the wrong if we were so secret Then he offered to give us a chance of talking to Lord St Simon alone and so we came right away round
to his rooms at once Now Robert you have heard it all and I am very sorry if I have given you pain and I hope that you do not think very meanly of me
Lord St Simon had by no means relaxed his rigid attitude but had listened with a frowning brow and a compressed lip to this long narrative
Excuse me he said but it is not my custom to discuss my most intimate personal affairs in this public manner
Then you won t forgive me You won t shake hands before I go Oh certainly if it would give you any pleasure He put out his hand and coldly grasped that which she
I had hoped suggested Holmes that you would have joined us in a friendly supper I think that there you ask a little too much responded his Lordship I may be forced to acquiesce in these
recent developments but I can hardly be expected to make merry over them I think that with your permission I will now wish you all a very good night He included us all in a sweeping bow and stalked out of the room
Then I trust that you at least will honour me with your company said Sherlock Holmes It is always a joy to meet an American Mr Moulton for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the
blundering of a minister in far gone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world wide country under a flag which shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes
The case has been an interesting one remarked Holmes when our visitors had left us because it serves to show very clearly how simple the explanation may be of an affair which at first sight seems to be almost
inexplicable Nothing could be more natural than the sequence of events as narrated by this lady and nothing stranger than the result when viewed for instance by Mr Lestrade of Scotland Yard
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
You were not yourself at fault at all then From the first two facts were very obvious to me the one that the lady had been quite willing to undergo the
wedding ceremony the other that she had repented of it within a few minutes of returning home Obviously something had occurred during the morning then to cause her to change her mind What could that something
be She could not have spoken to anyone when she was out for she had been in the company of the bridegroom
Had she seen someone then If she had it must be someone from America because she had spent so short a time in this country that she could hardly have allowed anyone to acquire so deep an influence over her that the mere
sight of him would induce her to change her plans so completely You see we have already arrived by a process of exclusion at the idea that she might have seen an American Then who could this American be and why
should he possess so much influence over her It might be a lover it might be a husband Her young womanhood had I knew been spent in rough scenes and under strange conditions So far I had got before I ever
heard Lord St Simon s narrative When he told us of a man in a pew of the change in the bride s manner of so transparent a device for obtaining a note as the dropping of a bouquet of her resort to her confidential maid and
of her very significant allusion to claim jumping which in miners parlance means taking possession of that which another person has a prior claim to the whole situation became absolutely clear She had gone off with a
man and the man was either a lover or was a previous husband the chances being in favour of the latter And how in the world did you find them
It might have been difficult but friend Lestrade held information in his hands the value of which he did not himself know The initials were of course of the highest importance but more valuable still was it to know that
within a week he had settled his bill at one of the most select London hotels How did you deduce the select
By the select prices Eight shillings for a bed and eightpence for a glass of sherry pointed to one of the most expensive hotels There are not many in London which charge at that rate In the second one which I visited in
Northumberland Avenue I learned by an inspection of the book that Francis H Moulton an American gentleman had left only the day before and on looking over the entries against him I came upon the very items
which I had seen in the duplicate bill His letters were to be forwarded to Gordon Square so thither I travelled and being fortunate enough to find the loving couple at home I ventured to give them some paternal
advice and to point out to them that it would be better in every way that they should make their position a little clearer both to the general public and to Lord St Simon in particular I invited them to meet him here and as
you see I made him keep the appointment But with no very good result I remarked His conduct was certainly not very gracious
Ah Watson said Holmes smiling perhaps you would not be very gracious either if after all the trouble of wooing and wedding you found yourself deprived in an instant of wife and of fortune I think that we may judge
Lord St Simon very mercifully and thank our stars that we are never likely to find ourselves in the same position Draw your chair up and hand me my violin for the only problem we have still to solve is how to while

THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET Holmes said I as I stood one morning in our bow window looking down the street here is a madman
coming along It seems rather sad that his relatives should allow him to come out alone My friend rose lazily from his armchair and stood with his hands in the pockets of his dressing gown looking
over my shoulder It was a bright crisp February morning and the snow of the day before still lay deep upon the ground shimmering brightly in the wintry sun Down the centre of Baker Street it had been ploughed into a
brown crumbly band by the traffic but at either side and on the heaped up edges of the footpaths it still lay as white as when it fell The grey pavement had been cleaned and scraped but was still dangerously slippery so
that there were fewer passengers than usual Indeed from the direction of the Metropolitan Station no one was coming save the single gentleman whose eccentric conduct had drawn my attention
He was a man of about fifty tall portly and imposing with a massive strongly marked face and a commanding figure He was dressed in a sombre yet rich style in black frock coat shining hat neat brown
gaiters and well cut pearl grey trousers Yet his actions were in absurd contrast to the dignity of his dress and features for he was running hard with occasional little springs such as a weary man gives who is little
accustomed to set any tax upon his legs As he ran he jerked his hands up and down waggled his head and writhed his face into the most extraordinary contortions
What on earth can be the matter with him I asked He is looking up at the numbers of the houses I believe that he is coming here said Holmes rubbing his hands
Here Yes I rather think he is coming to consult me professionally I think that I recognise the symptoms Ha did I
not tell you As he spoke the man puffing and blowing rushed at our door and pulled at our bell until the whole house resounded with the clanging
A few moments later he was in our room still puffing still gesticulating but with so fixed a look of grief and despair in his eyes that our smiles were turned in an instant to horror and pity For a while he could not get his
words out but swayed his body and plucked at his hair like one who has been driven to the extreme limits of his reason Then suddenly springing to his feet he beat his head against the wall with such force that we both
rushed upon him and tore him away to the centre of the room Sherlock Holmes pushed him down into the easychair and sitting beside him patted his hand and chatted with him in the easy soothing tones which he knew so well how to employ
You have come to me to tell your story have you not said he You are fatigued with your haste Pray wait until you have recovered yourself and then I shall be most happy to look into any little problem which you may
submit to me The man sat for a minute or more with a heaving chest fighting against his emotion Then he passed his
handkerchief over his brow set his lips tight and turned his face towards us
No doubt you think me mad said he
I see that you have had some great trouble responded Holmes
God knows I have a trouble which is enough to unseat my reason so sudden and so terrible is it Public disgrace I might have faced although I am a man whose character has never yet borne a stain Private affliction
also is the lot of every man but the two coming together and in so frightful a form have been enough to shake my very soul Besides it is not I alone The very noblest in the land may suffer unless some way be found out of
this horrible affair Pray compose yourself sir said Holmes and let me have a clear account of who you are and what it is that
has befallen you PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html My name answered our visitor is probably familiar to your ears I am Alexander Holder of the banking
firm of Holder Stevenson of Threadneedle Street The name was indeed well known to us as belonging to the senior partner in the second largest private
banking concern in the City of London What could have happened then to bring one of the foremost citizens of London to this most pitiable pass We waited all curiosity until with another effort he braced himself to tell his
I feel that time is of value said he that is why I hastened here when the police inspector suggested that I should secure your co operation I came to Baker Street by the Underground and hurried from there on foot for
the cabs go slowly through this snow That is why I was so out of breath for I am a man who takes very little exercise I feel better now and I will put the facts before you as shortly and yet as clearly as I can
It is of course well known to you that in a successful banking business as much depends upon our being able to find remunerative investments for our funds as upon our increasing our connection and the number of our
depositors One of our most lucrative means of laying out money is in the shape of loans where the security is unimpeachable We have done a good deal in this direction during the last few years and there are many noble
families to whom we have advanced large sums upon the security of their pictures libraries or plate
Yesterday morning I was seated in my office at the bank when a card was brought in to me by one of the clerks I started when I saw the name for it was that of none other than well perhaps even to you I had better
say no more than that it was a name which is a household word all over the earth one of the highest noblest most exalted names in England I was overwhelmed by the honour and attempted when he entered to say so
but he plunged at once into business with the air of a man who wishes to hurry quickly through a disagreeable task
Mr Holder said he I have been informed that you are in the habit of advancing money The firm does so when the security is good I answered
It is absolutely essential to me said he that I should have at once I could of course borrow so trifling a sum ten times over from my friends but I much prefer to make it a matter of business and to carry out
that business myself In my position you can readily understand that it is unwise to place one s self under obligations
For how long may I ask do you want this sum I asked
Next Monday I have a large sum due to me and I shall then most certainly repay what you advance with whatever interest you think it right to charge But it is very essential to me that the money should be paid at
once I should be happy to advance it without further parley from my own private purse said I were it not that
the strain would be rather more than it could bear If on the other hand I am to do it in the name of the firm then in justice to my partner I must insist that even in your case every businesslike precaution should be taken
I should much prefer to have it so said he raising up a square black morocco case which he had laid beside his chair You have doubtless heard of the Beryl Coronet
One of the most precious public possessions of the empire said I
Precisely He opened the case and there imbedded in soft flesh coloured velvet lay the magnificent piece of jewellery which he had named There are thirty nine enormous beryls said he and the price of the gold
chasing is incalculable The lowest estimate would put the worth of the coronet at double the sum which I have asked I am prepared to leave it with you as my security
I took the precious case into my hands and looked in some perplexity from it to my illustrious client
You doubt its value he asked
Not at all I only doubt The propriety of my leaving it You may set your mind at rest about that I should not dream of doing so
were it not absolutely certain that I should be able in four days to reclaim it It is a pure matter of form Is the security sufficient
Ample You understand Mr Holder that I am giving you a strong proof of the confidence which I have in you
founded upon all that I have heard of you I rely upon you not only to be discreet and to refrain from all gossip PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html upon the matter but above all to preserve this coronet with every possible precaution because I need not say that
a great public scandal would be caused if any harm were to befall it Any injury to it would be almost as serious as its complete loss for there are no beryls in the world to match these and it would be impossible to replace
them I leave it with you however with every confidence and I shall call for it in person on Monday morning Seeing that my client was anxious to leave I said no more but calling for my cashier I ordered him to pay
over fifty notes When I was alone once more however with the precious case lying upon the table in front of me I could not but think with some misgivings of the immense responsibility which it entailed upon me
There could be no doubt that as it was a national possession a horrible scandal would ensue if any misfortune should occur to it I already regretted having ever consented to take charge of it However it was too late to alter
the matter now so I locked it up in my private safe and turned once more to my work
When evening came I felt that it would be an imprudence to leave so precious a thing in the office behind me Bankers safes had been forced before now and why should not mine be If so how terrible would be the
position in which I should find myself I determined therefore that for the next few days I would always carry the case backward and forward with me so that it might never be really out of my reach With this intention I
called a cab and drove out to my house at Streatham carrying the jewel with me I did not breathe freely until I had taken it upstairs and locked it in the bureau of my dressing room
And now a word as to my household Mr Holmes for I wish you to thoroughly understand the situation My groom and my page sleep out of the house and may be set aside altogether I have three maid servants who have
been with me a number of years and whose absolute reliability is quite above suspicion Another Lucy Parr the second waiting maid has only been in my service a few months She came with an excellent character however
and has always given me satisfaction She is a very pretty girl and has attracted admirers who have occasionally hung about the place That is the only drawback which we have found to her but we believe her to be a
thoroughly good girl in every way
So much for the servants My family itself is so small that it will not take me long to describe it I am a widower and have an only son Arthur He has been a disappointment to me Mr Holmes a grievous
disappointment I have no doubt that I am myself to blame People tell me that I have spoiled him Very likely I have When my dear wife died I felt that he was all I had to love I could not bear to see the smile fade even for a
moment from his face I have never denied him a wish Perhaps it would have been better for both of us had I been sterner but I meant it for the best
It was naturally my intention that he should succeed me in my business but he was not of a business turn He was wild wayward and to speak the truth I could not trust him in the handling of large sums of money When
he was young he became a member of an aristocratic club and there having charming manners he was soon the intimate of a number of men with long purses and expensive habits He learned to play heavily at cards and to
squander money on the turf until he had again and again to come to me and implore me to give him an advance upon his allowance that he might settle his debts of honour He tried more than once to break away from the
dangerous company which he was keeping but each time the influence of his friend Sir George Burnwell was enough to draw him back again
And indeed I could not wonder that such a man as Sir George Burnwell should gain an influence over him for he has frequently brought him to my house and I have found myself that I could hardly resist the fascination
of his manner He is older than Arthur a man of the world to his finger tips one who had been everywhere seen everything a brilliant talker and a man of great personal beauty Yet when I think of him in cold blood far away
from the glamour of his presence I am convinced from his cynical speech and the look which I have caught in his eyes that he is one who should be deeply distrusted So I think and so too thinks my little Mary who has a
woman s quick insight into character
And now there is only she to be described She is my niece but when my brother died five years ago and left her alone in the world I adopted her and have looked upon her ever since as my daughter She is a sunbeam in
my house sweet loving beautiful a wonderful manager and housekeeper yet as tender and quiet and gentle as a woman could be She is my right hand I do not know what I could do without her In only one matter has she
ever gone against my wishes Twice my boy has asked her to marry him for he loves her devotedly but each time she has refused him I think that if anyone could have drawn him into the right path it would have been she
and that his marriage might have changed his whole life but now alas it is too late forever too late

Now Mr Holmes you know the people who live under my roof and I shall continue with my miserable story
When we were taking coffee in the drawing room that night after dinner I told Arthur and Mary my experience and of the precious treasure which we had under our roof suppressing only the name of my client
Lucy Parr who had brought in the coffee had I am sure left the room but I cannot swear that the door was closed Mary and Arthur were much interested and wished to see the famous coronet but I thought it better not
Where have you put it asked Arthur
In my own bureau Well I hope to goodness the house won t be burgled during the night said he
It is locked up I answered
Oh any old key will fit that bureau When I was a youngster I have opened it myself with the key of the box room cupboard
He often had a wild way of talking so that I thought little of what he said He followed me to my room however that night with a very grave face
Look here dad said he with his eyes cast down can you let me have No I cannot I answered sharply I have been far too generous with you in money matters
You have been very kind said he but I must have this money or else I can never show my face inside the club again
And a very good thing too I cried
Yes but you would not have me leave it a dishonoured man said he I could not bear the disgrace I must raise the money in some way and if you will not let me have it then I must try other means
I was very angry for this was the third demand during the month You shall not have a farthing from me I cried on which he bowed and left the room without another word
When he was gone I unlocked my bureau made sure that my treasure was safe and locked it again Then I started to go round the house to see that all was secure a duty which I usually leave to Mary but which I
thought it well to perform myself that night As I came down the stairs I saw Mary herself at the side window of the hall which she closed and fastened as I approached
Tell me dad said she looking I thought a little disturbed did you give Lucy the maid leave to go out tonight Certainly not
She came in just now by the back door I have no doubt that she has only been to the side gate to see someone but I think that it is hardly safe and should be stopped
You must speak to her in the morning or I will if you prefer it Are you sure that everything is fastened Quite sure dad
Then good night I kissed her and went up to my bedroom again where I was soon asleep
I am endeavouring to tell you everything Mr Holmes which may have any bearing upon the case but I beg that you will question me upon any point which I do not make clear
On the contrary your statement is singularly lucid I come to a part of my story now in which I should wish to be particularly so I am not a very heavy sleeper
and the anxiety in my mind tended no doubt to make me even less so than usual About two in the morning then I was awakened by some sound in the house It had ceased ere I was wide awake but it had left an
impression behind it as though a window had gently closed somewhere I lay listening with all my ears
Suddenly to my horror there was a distinct sound of footsteps moving softly in the next room I slipped out of bed all palpitating with fear and peeped round the corner of my dressing room door
Arthur I screamed you villain you thief How dare you touch that coronet The gas was half up as I had left it and my unhappy boy dressed only in his shirt and trousers was standing
beside the light holding the coronet in his hands He appeared to be wrenching at it or bending it with all his PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html strength At my cry he dropped it from his grasp and turned as pale as death I snatched it up and examined it
One of the gold corners with three of the beryls in it was missing
You blackguard I shouted beside myself with rage You have destroyed it You have dishonoured me forever Where are the jewels which you have stolen
Stolen he cried
Yes thief I roared shaking him by the shoulder
There are none missing There cannot be any missing said he
There are three missing And you know where they are Must I call you a liar as well as a thief Did I not see you trying to tear off another piece
You have called me names enough said he I will not stand it any longer I shall not say another word about this business since you have chosen to insult me I will leave your house in the morning and make my
own way in the world You shall leave it in the hands of the police I cried half mad with grief and rage I shall have this matter
probed to the bottom You shall learn nothing from me said he with a passion such as I should not have thought was in his nature
If you choose to call the police let the police find what they can By this time the whole house was astir for I had raised my voice in my anger Mary was the first to rush into
my room and at the sight of the coronet and of Arthur s face she read the whole story and with a scream fell down senseless on the ground I sent the housemaid for the police and put the investigation into their hands at
once When the inspector and a constable entered the house Arthur who had stood sullenly with his arms folded asked me whether it was my intention to charge him with theft I answered that it had ceased to be a
private matter but had become a public one since the ruined coronet was national property I was determined that the law should have its way in everything
At least said he you will not have me arrested at once It would be to your advantage as well as mine if I might leave the house for five minutes
That you may get away or perhaps that you may conceal what you have stolen said I And then realising the dreadful position in which I was placed I implored him to remember that not only my honour but that of one
who was far greater than I was at stake and that he threatened to raise a scandal which would convulse the nation He might avert it all if he would but tell me what he had done with the three missing stones
You may as well face the matter said I you have been caught in the act and no confession could make your guilt more heinous If you but make such reparation as is in your power by telling us where the beryls are
all shall be forgiven and forgotten Keep your forgiveness for those who ask for it he answered turning away from me with a sneer I saw that
he was too hardened for any words of mine to influence him There was but one way for it I called in the inspector and gave him into custody A search was made at once not only of his person but of his room and of
every portion of the house where he could possibly have concealed the gems but no trace of them could be found nor would the wretched boy open his mouth for all our persuasions and our threats This morning he was
removed to a cell and I after going through all the police formalities have hurried round to you to implore you to use your skill in unravelling the matter The police have openly confessed that they can at present make
nothing of it You may go to any expense which you think necessary I have already offered a reward of
My God what shall I do I have lost my honour my gems and my son in one night Oh what shall I do He put a hand on either side of his head and rocked himself to and fro droning to himself like a child whose
grief has got beyond words
Sherlock Holmes sat silent for some few minutes with his brows knitted and his eyes fixed upon the fire
Do you receive much company he asked
None save my partner with his family and an occasional friend of Arthur s Sir George Burnwell has been several times lately No one else I think
Do you go out much in society Arthur does Mary and I stay at home We neither of us care for it
That is unusual in a young girl PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html She is of a quiet nature Besides she is not so very young She is four and twenty
This matter from what you say seems to have been a shock to her also Terrible She is even more affected than I
You have neither of you any doubt as to your son s guilt How can we have when I saw him with my own eyes with the coronet in his hands
I hardly consider that a conclusive proof Was the remainder of the coronet at all injured Yes it was twisted
Do you not think then that he might have been trying to straighten it God bless you You are doing what you can for him and for me But it is too heavy a task What was he doing
there at all If his purpose were innocent why did he not say so Precisely And if it were guilty why did he not invent a lie His silence appears to me to cut both ways There
are several singular points about the case What did the police think of the noise which awoke you from your sleep
They considered that it might be caused by Arthur s closing his bedroom door A likely story As if a man bent on felony would slam his door so as to wake a household What did they say
then of the disappearance of these gems They are still sounding the planking and probing the furniture in the hope of finding them
Have they thought of looking outside the house Yes they have shown extraordinary energy The whole garden has already been minutely examined
Now my dear sir said Holmes is it not obvious to you now that this matter really strikes very much deeper than either you or the police were at first inclined to think It appeared to you to be a simple case to me
it seems exceedingly complex Consider what is involved by your theory You suppose that your son came down from his bed went at great risk to your dressing room opened your bureau took out your coronet broke off by
main force a small portion of it went off to some other place concealed three gems out of the thirty nine with such skill that nobody can find them and then returned with the other thirty six into the room in which he
exposed himself to the greatest danger of being discovered I ask you now is such a theory tenable But what other is there cried the banker with a gesture of despair If his motives were innocent why does
he not explain them It is our task to find that out replied Holmes so now if you please Mr Holder we will set off for
Streatham together and devote an hour to glancing a little more closely into details My friend insisted upon my accompanying them in their expedition which I was eager enough to do for my
curiosity and sympathy were deeply stirred by the story to which we had listened I confess that the guilt of the banker s son appeared to me to be as obvious as it did to his unhappy father but still I had such faith in Holmes
judgment that I felt that there must be some grounds for hope as long as he was dissatisfied with the accepted explanation He hardly spoke a word the whole way out to the southern suburb but sat with his chin upon his
breast and his hat drawn over his eyes sunk in the deepest thought Our client appeared to have taken fresh heart at the little glimpse of hope which had been presented to him and he even broke into a desultory chat with me
over his business affairs A short railway journey and a shorter walk brought us to Fairbank the modest residence of the great financier
Fairbank was a good sized square house of white stone standing back a little from the road A double carriage sweep with a snow clad lawn stretched down in front to two large iron gates which closed the
entrance On the right side was a small wooden thicket which led into a narrow path between two neat hedges stretching from the road to the kitchen door and forming the tradesmen s entrance On the left ran a lane which
led to the stables and was not itself within the grounds at all being a public though little used thoroughfare
Holmes left us standing at the door and walked slowly all round the house across the front down the tradesmen s path and so round by the garden behind into the stable lane So long was he that Mr Holder and I
went into the dining room and waited by the fire until he should return We were sitting there in silence when the door opened and a young lady came in She was rather above the middle height slim with dark hair and eyes
which seemed the darker against the absolute pallor of her skin I do not think that I have ever seen such deadly paleness in a woman s face Her lips too were bloodless but her eyes were flushed with crying As she swept
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
silently into the room she impressed me with a greater sense of grief than the banker had done in the morning and it was the more striking in her as she was evidently a woman of strong character with immense capacity for
self restraint Disregarding my presence she went straight to her uncle and passed her hand over his head with a sweet womanly caress
You have given orders that Arthur should be liberated have you not dad she asked
No no my girl the matter must be probed to the bottom But I am so sure that he is innocent You know what woman s instincts are I know that he has done no harm
and that you will be sorry for having acted so harshly Why is he silent then if he is innocent
Who knows Perhaps because he was so angry that you should suspect him How could I help suspecting him when I actually saw him with the coronet in his hand
Oh but he had only picked it up to look at it Oh do do take my word for it that he is innocent Let the matter drop and say no more It is so dreadful to think of our dear Arthur in prison
I shall never let it drop until the gems are found never Mary Your affection for Arthur blinds you as to the awful consequences to me Far from hushing the thing up I have brought a gentleman down from London to
inquire more deeply into it This gentleman she asked facing round to me
No his friend He wished us to leave him alone He is round in the stable lane now The stable lane She raised her dark eyebrows What can he hope to find there Ah this I suppose is he I
trust sir that you will succeed in proving what I feel sure is the truth that my cousin Arthur is innocent of this crime
I fully share your opinion and I trust with you that we may prove it returned Holmes going back to the mat to knock the snow from his shoes I believe I have the honour of addressing Miss Mary Holder Might I ask
you a question or two Pray do sir if it may help to clear this horrible affair up
You heard nothing yourself last night Nothing until my uncle here began to speak loudly I heard that and I came down
You shut up the windows and doors the night before Did you fasten all the windows Yes
Were they all fastened this morning Yes
You have a maid who has a sweetheart I think that you remarked to your uncle last night that she had been out to see him
Yes and she was the girl who waited in the drawing room and who may have heard uncle s remarks about the coronet
I see You infer that she may have gone out to tell her sweetheart and that the two may have planned the robbery
But what is the good of all these vague theories cried the banker impatiently when I have told you that I saw Arthur with the coronet in his hands
Wait a little Mr Holder We must come back to that About this girl Miss Holder You saw her return by the kitchen door I presume
Yes when I went to see if the door was fastened for the night I met her slipping in I saw the man too in the gloom
Do you know him Oh yes he is the greengrocer who brings our vegetables round His name is Francis Prosper
He stood said Holmes to the left of the door that is to say farther up the path than is necessary to reach the door
Yes he did PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html And he is a man with a wooden leg
Something like fear sprang up in the young lady s expressive black eyes Why you are like a magician said she How do you know that She smiled but there was no answering smile in Holmes thin eager face
I should be very glad now to go upstairs said he I shall probably wish to go over the outside of the house again Perhaps I had better take a look at the lower windows before I go up
He walked swiftly round from one to the other pausing only at the large one which looked from the hall onto the stable lane This he opened and made a very careful examination of the sill with his powerful magnifying
lens Now we shall go upstairs said he at last
The banker s dressing room was a plainly furnished little chamber with a grey carpet a large bureau and a long mirror Holmes went to the bureau first and looked hard at the lock
Which key was used to open it he asked
That which my son himself indicated that of the cupboard of the lumber room Have you it here
That is it on the dressing table Sherlock Holmes took it up and opened the bureau
It is a noiseless lock said he It is no wonder that it did not wake you This case I presume contains the coronet We must have a look at it He opened the case and taking out the diadem he laid it upon the table It
was a magnificent specimen of the jeweller s art and the thirty six stones were the finest that I have ever seen
At one side of the coronet was a cracked edge where a corner holding three gems had been torn away
Now Mr Holder said Holmes here is the corner which corresponds to that which has been so unfortunately lost Might I beg that you will break it off
The banker recoiled in horror I should not dream of trying said he
Then I will Holmes suddenly bent his strength upon it but without result I feel it give a little said he
but though I am exceptionally strong in the fingers it would take me all my time to break it An ordinary man could not do it Now what do you think would happen if I did break it Mr Holder There would be a noise like
a pistol shot Do you tell me that all this happened within a few yards of your bed and that you heard nothing of it
I do not know what to think It is all dark to me But perhaps it may grow lighter as we go What do you think Miss Holder
I confess that I still share my uncle s perplexity Your son had no shoes or slippers on when you saw him
He had nothing on save only his trousers and shirt Thank you We have certainly been favoured with extraordinary luck during this inquiry and it will be
entirely our own fault if we do not succeed in clearing the matter up With your permission Mr Holder I shall now continue my investigations outside
He went alone at his own request for he explained that any unnecessary footmarks might make his task more difficult For an hour or more he was at work returning at last with his feet heavy with snow and his features as
inscrutable as ever
I think that I have seen now all that there is to see Mr Holder said he I can serve you best by returning to my rooms
But the gems Mr Holmes Where are they I cannot tell
The banker wrung his hands I shall never see them again he cried And my son You give me hopes My opinion is in no way altered
Then for God s sake what was this dark business which was acted in my house last night If you can call upon me at my Baker Street rooms to morrow morning between nine and ten I shall be happy
to do what I can to make it clearer I understand that you give me carte blanche to act for you provided only that I get back the gems and that you place no limit on the sum I may draw

I would give my fortune to have them back Very good I shall look into the matter between this and then Good bye it is just possible that I may have to
come over here again before evening It was obvious to me that my companion s mind was now made up about the case although what his
conclusions were was more than I could even dimly imagine Several times during our homeward journey I endeavoured to sound him upon the point but he always glided away to some other topic until at last I gave it
over in despair It was not yet three when we found ourselves in our rooms once more He hurried to his chamber and was down again in a few minutes dressed as a common loafer With his collar turned up his shiny seedy
coat his red cravat and his worn boots he was a perfect sample of the class
I think that this should do said he glancing into the glass above the fireplace I only wish that you could come with me Watson but I fear that it won t do I may be on the trail in this matter or I may be following a
will o the wisp but I shall soon know which it is I hope that I may be back in a few hours He cut a slice of beef from the joint upon the sideboard sandwiched it between two rounds of bread and thrusting this rude meal
into his pocket he started off upon his expedition
I had just finished my tea when he returned evidently in excellent spirits swinging an old elastic sided boot in his hand He chucked it down into a corner and helped himself to a cup of tea
I only looked in as I passed said he I am going right on Where to
Oh to the other side of the West End It may be some time before I get back Don t wait up for me in case I should be late
How are you getting on Oh so so Nothing to complain of I have been out to Streatham since I saw you last but I did not call at the
house It is a very sweet little problem and I would not have missed it for a good deal However I must not sit gossiping here but must get these disreputable clothes off and return to my highly respectable self
I could see by his manner that he had stronger reasons for satisfaction than his words alone would imply His eyes twinkled and there was even a touch of colour upon his sallow cheeks He hastened upstairs and a few
minutes later I heard the slam of the hall door which told me that he was off once more upon his congenial hunt
I waited until midnight but there was no sign of his return so I retired to my room It was no uncommon thing for him to be away for days and nights on end when he was hot upon a scent so that his lateness caused me no
surprise I do not know at what hour he came in but when I came down to breakfast in the morning there he was with a cup of coffee in one hand and the paper in the other as fresh and trim as possible
You will excuse my beginning without you Watson said he but you remember that our client has rather an early appointment this morning
Why it is after nine now I answered I should not be surprised if that were he I thought I heard a ring It was indeed our friend the financier I was shocked by the change which had come over him for his face
which was naturally of a broad and massive mould was now pinched and fallen in while his hair seemed to me at least a shade whiter He entered with a weariness and lethargy which was even more painful than his violence
of the morning before and he dropped heavily into the armchair which I pushed forward for him
I do not know what I have done to be so severely tried said he Only two days ago I was a happy and prosperous man without a care in the world Now I am left to a lonely and dishonoured age One sorrow comes
close upon the heels of another My niece Mary has deserted me Deserted you
Yes Her bed this morning had not been slept in her room was empty and a note for me lay upon the hall table I had said to her last night in sorrow and not in anger that if she had married my boy all might have been
well with him Perhaps it was thoughtless of me to say so It is to that remark that she refers in this note
MY DEAREST UNCLE I feel that I have brought trouble upon you and that if I had acted differently this terrible misfortune might never have occurred I cannot with this
thought in my mind ever again be happy under your roof and I feel that I must leave you forever Do not worry about my future for that is provided for and above all do not

search for me for it will be fruitless labour and an ill service to me In life or in death I am ever your loving
MARY What could she mean by that note Mr Holmes Do you think it points to suicide
No no nothing of the kind It is perhaps the best possible solution I trust Mr Holder that you are nearing the end of your troubles
Ha You say so You have heard something Mr Holmes you have learned something Where are the gems You would not think apiece an excessive sum for them
I would pay ten That would be unnecessary Three thousand will cover the matter And there is a little reward I fancy Have
you your cheque book Here is a pen Better make it out for With a dazed face the banker made out the required check Holmes walked over to his desk took out a little
triangular piece of gold with three gems in it and threw it down upon the table
With a shriek of joy our client clutched it up
You have it he gasped I am saved I am saved The reaction of joy was as passionate as his grief had been and he hugged his recovered gems to his bosom
There is one other thing you owe Mr Holder said Sherlock Holmes rather sternly
Owe He caught up a pen Name the sum and I will pay it No the debt is not to me You owe a very humble apology to that noble lad your son who has carried
himself in this matter as I should be proud to see my own son do should I ever chance to have one Then it was not Arthur who took them
I told you yesterday and I repeat to day that it was not You are sure of it Then let us hurry to him at once to let him know that the truth is known
He knows it already When I had cleared it all up I had an interview with him and finding that he would not tell me the story I told it to him on which he had to confess that I was right and to add the very few details
which were not yet quite clear to me Your news of this morning however may open his lips For Heaven s sake tell me then what is this extraordinary mystery
I will do so and I will show you the steps by which I reached it And let me say to you first that which it is hardest for me to say and for you to hear there has been an understanding between Sir George Burnwell and
your niece Mary They have now fled together My Mary Impossible
It is unfortunately more than possible it is certain Neither you nor your son knew the true character of this man when you admitted him into your family circle He is one of the most dangerous men in England a ruined
gambler an absolutely desperate villain a man without heart or conscience Your niece knew nothing of such men When he breathed his vows to her as he had done to a hundred before her she flattered herself that she
alone had touched his heart The devil knows best what he said but at least she became his tool and was in the habit of seeing him nearly every evening
I cannot and I will not believe it cried the banker with an ashen face
I will tell you then what occurred in your house last night Your niece when you had as she thought gone to your room slipped down and talked to her lover through the window which leads into the stable lane His
footmarks had pressed right through the snow so long had he stood there She told him of the coronet His wicked lust for gold kindled at the news and he bent her to his will I have no doubt that she loved you but there
are women in whom the love of a lover extinguishes all other loves and I think that she must have been one She had hardly listened to his instructions when she saw you coming downstairs on which she closed the window
rapidly and told you about one of the servants escapade with her wooden legged lover which was all perfectly true
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Your boy Arthur went to bed after his interview with you but he slept badly on account of his uneasiness about his club debts In the middle of the night he heard a soft tread pass his door so he rose and looking out
was surprised to see his cousin walking very stealthily along the passage until she disappeared into your dressing room Petrified with astonishment the lad slipped on some clothes and waited there in the dark to see
what would come of this strange affair Presently she emerged from the room again and in the light of the passage lamp your son saw that she carried the precious coronet in her hands She passed down the stairs and
he thrilling with horror ran along and slipped behind the curtain near your door whence he could see what passed in the hall beneath He saw her stealthily open the window hand out the coronet to someone in the
gloom and then closing it once more hurry back to her room passing quite close to where he stood hid behind the curtain
As long as she was on the scene he could not take any action without a horrible exposure of the woman whom he loved But the instant that she was gone he realised how crushing a misfortune this would be for you
and how all important it was to set it right He rushed down just as he was in his bare feet opened the window sprang out into the snow and ran down the lane where he could see a dark figure in the moonlight Sir George
Burnwell tried to get away but Arthur caught him and there was a struggle between them your lad tugging at one side of the coronet and his opponent at the other In the scuffle your son struck Sir George and cut him over
the eye Then something suddenly snapped and your son finding that he had the coronet in his hands rushed back closed the window ascended to your room and had just observed that the coronet had been twisted in the
struggle and was endeavouring to straighten it when you appeared upon the scene Is it possible gasped the banker
You then roused his anger by calling him names at a moment when he felt that he had deserved your warmest thanks He could not explain the true state of affairs without betraying one who certainly deserved little enough
consideration at his hands He took the more chivalrous view however and preserved her secret And that was why she shrieked and fainted when she saw the coronet cried Mr Holder Oh my God what
a blind fool I have been And his asking to be allowed to go out for five minutes The dear fellow wanted to see if the missing piece were at the scene of the struggle How cruelly I have misjudged him
When I arrived at the house continued Holmes I at once went very carefully round it to observe if there were any traces in the snow which might help me I knew that none had fallen since the evening before and also
that there had been a strong frost to preserve impressions I passed along the tradesmen s path but found it all trampled down and indistinguishable Just beyond it however at the far side of the kitchen door a woman had
stood and talked with a man whose round impressions on one side showed that he had a wooden leg I could even tell that they had been disturbed for the woman had run back swiftly to the door as was shown by the deep
toe and light heel marks while Wooden leg had waited a little and then had gone away I thought at the time that this might be the maid and her sweetheart of whom you had already spoken to me and inquiry showed it was
so I passed round the garden without seeing anything more than random tracks which I took to be the police
but when I got into the stable lane a very long and complex story was written in the snow in front of me
There was a double line of tracks of a booted man and a second double line which I saw with delight belonged to a man with naked feet I was at once convinced from what you had told me that the latter was your
son The first had walked both ways but the other had run swiftly and as his tread was marked in places over the depression of the boot it was obvious that he had passed after the other I followed them up and found they led
to the hall window where Boots had worn all the snow away while waiting Then I walked to the other end which was a hundred yards or more down the lane I saw where Boots had faced round where the snow was cut
up as though there had been a struggle and finally where a few drops of blood had fallen to show me that I was not mistaken Boots had then run down the lane and another little smudge of blood showed that it was he who
had been hurt When he came to the high road at the other end I found that the pavement had been cleared so there was an end to that clue
On entering the house however I examined as you remember the sill and framework of the hall window with my lens and I could at once see that someone had passed out I could distinguish the outline of an instep
where the wet foot had been placed in coming in I was then beginning to be able to form an opinion as to what had occurred A man had waited outside the window someone had brought the gems the deed had been
overseen by your son he had pursued the thief had struggled with him they had each tugged at the coronet their united strength causing injuries which neither alone could have effected He had returned with the prize but

had left a fragment in the grasp of his opponent So far I was clear The question now was who was the man and who was it brought him the coronet
It is an old maxim of mine that when you have excluded the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth Now I knew that it was not you who had brought it down so there only remained
your niece and the maids But if it were the maids why should your son allow himself to be accused in their place There could be no possible reason As he loved his cousin however there was an excellent explanation
why he should retain her secret the more so as the secret was a disgraceful one When I remembered that you had seen her at that window and how she had fainted on seeing the coronet again my conjecture became a
And who could it be who was her confederate A lover evidently for who else could outweigh the love and gratitude which she must feel to you I knew that you went out little and that your circle of friends was a very
limited one But among them was Sir George Burnwell I had heard of him before as being a man of evil reputation among women It must have been he who wore those boots and retained the missing gems Even
though he knew that Arthur had discovered him he might still flatter himself that he was safe for the lad could not say a word without compromising his own family
Well your own good sense will suggest what measures I took next I went in the shape of a loafer to Sir George s house managed to pick up an acquaintance with his valet learned that his master had cut his head the
night before and finally at the expense of six shillings made all sure by buying a pair of his cast off shoes
With these I journeyed down to Streatham and saw that they exactly fitted the tracks I saw an ill dressed vagabond in the lane yesterday evening said Mr Holder
Precisely It was I I found that I had my man so I came home and changed my clothes It was a delicate part which I had to play then for I saw that a prosecution must be avoided to avert scandal and I knew that so astute
a villain would see that our hands were tied in the matter I went and saw him At first of course he denied everything But when I gave him every particular that had occurred he tried to bluster and took down a lifepreserver from the wall I knew my man however and I clapped a pistol to his head before he could strike Then
he became a little more reasonable I told him that we would give him a price for the stones he held apiece That brought out the first signs of grief that he had shown Why dash it all said he I ve let them go at
six hundred for the three I soon managed to get the address of the receiver who had them on promising him that there would be no prosecution Off I set to him and after much chaffering I got our stones at apiece
Then I looked in upon your son told him that all was right and eventually got to my bed about two o clock after what I may call a really hard day s work
A day which has saved England from a great public scandal said the banker rising Sir I cannot find words to thank you but you shall not find me ungrateful for what you have done Your skill has indeed exceeded
all that I have heard of it And now I must fly to my dear boy to apologise to him for the wrong which I have done him As to what you tell me of poor Mary it goes to my very heart Not even your skill can inform me
where she is now I think that we may safely say returned Holmes that she is wherever Sir George Burnwell is It is equally
certain too that whatever her sins are they will soon receive a more than sufficient punishment PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg

THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES To the man who loves art for its own sake remarked Sherlock Holmes tossing aside the advertisement
sheet of The Daily Telegraph it is frequently in its least important and lowliest manifestations that the keenest pleasure is to be derived It is pleasant to me to observe Watson that you have so far grasped this truth that in
these little records of our cases which you have been good enough to draw up and I am bound to say occasionally to embellish you have given prominence not so much to the many causes c l bres and sensational
trials in which I have figured but rather to those incidents which may have been trivial in themselves but which have given room for those faculties of deduction and of logical synthesis which I have made my special
province And yet said I smiling I cannot quite hold myself absolved from the charge of sensationalism which has
been urged against my records You have erred perhaps he observed taking up a glowing cinder with the tongs and lighting with it the
long cherry wood pipe which was wont to replace his clay when he was in a disputatious rather than a meditative mood you have erred perhaps in attempting to put colour and life into each of your statements instead of
confining yourself to the task of placing upon record that severe reasoning from cause to effect which is really the only notable feature about the thing
It seems to me that I have done you full justice in the matter I remarked with some coldness for I was repelled by the egotism which I had more than once observed to be a strong factor in my friend s singular
No it is not selfishness or conceit said he answering as was his wont my thoughts rather than my words
If I claim full justice for my art it is because it is an impersonal thing a thing beyond myself Crime is common Logic is rare Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell You have
degraded what should have been a course of lectures into a series of tales It was a cold morning of the early spring and we sat after breakfast on either side of a cheery fire in the old
room at Baker Street A thick fog rolled down between the lines of dun coloured houses and the opposing windows loomed like dark shapeless blurs through the heavy yellow wreaths Our gas was lit and shone on the
white cloth and glimmer of china and metal for the table had not been cleared yet Sherlock Holmes had been silent all the morning dipping continuously into the advertisement columns of a succession of papers until at
last having apparently given up his search he had emerged in no very sweet temper to lecture me upon my literary shortcomings
At the same time he remarked after a pause during which he had sat puffing at his long pipe and gazing down into the fire you can hardly be open to a charge of sensationalism for out of these cases which you have
been so kind as to interest yourself in a fair proportion do not treat of crime in its legal sense at all The small matter in which I endeavoured to help the King of Bohemia the singular experience of Miss Mary Sutherland
the problem connected with the man with the twisted lip and the incident of the noble bachelor were all matters which are outside the pale of the law But in avoiding the sensational I fear that you may have bordered on the
trivial The end may have been so I answered but the methods I hold to have been novel and of interest
Pshaw my dear fellow what do the public the great unobservant public who could hardly tell a weaver by his tooth or a compositor by his left thumb care about the finer shades of analysis and deduction But indeed if
you are trivial I cannot blame you for the days of the great cases are past Man or at least criminal man has lost all enterprise and originality As to my own little practice it seems to be degenerating into an agency for
recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding schools I think that I have touched PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html bottom at last however This note I had this morning marks my zero point I fancy Read it He tossed a
crumpled letter across to me
It was dated from Montague Place upon the preceding evening and ran thus
DEAR MR HOLMES I am very anxious to consult you as to whether I should or should not accept a situation which has been offered to me as governess I shall call at
half past ten to morrow if I do not inconvenience you Yours faithfully VIOLET HUNTER
Do you know the young lady I asked
Not I It is half past ten now
Yes and I have no doubt that is her ring It may turn out to be of more interest than you think You remember that the affair of the blue carbuncle
which appeared to be a mere whim at first developed into a serious investigation It may be so in this case also
Well let us hope so But our doubts will very soon be solved for here unless I am much mistaken is the person in question
As he spoke the door opened and a young lady entered the room She was plainly but neatly dressed with a bright quick face freckled like a plover s egg and with the brisk manner of a woman who has had her own way
to make in the world
You will excuse my troubling you I am sure said she as my companion rose to greet her but I have had a very strange experience and as I have no parents or relations of any sort from whom I could ask advice I
thought that perhaps you would be kind enough to tell me what I should do Pray take a seat Miss Hunter I shall be happy to do anything that I can to serve you
I could see that Holmes was favourably impressed by the manner and speech of his new client He looked her over in his searching fashion and then composed himself with his lids drooping and his finger tips together to
listen to her story
I have been a governess for five years said she in the family of Colonel Spence Munro but two months ago the colonel received an appointment at Halifax in Nova Scotia and took his children over to America with
him so that I found myself without a situation I advertised and I answered advertisements but without success
At last the little money which I had saved began to run short and I was at my wit s end as to what I should do
There is a well known agency for governesses in the West End called Westaway s and there I used to call about once a week in order to see whether anything had turned up which might suit me Westaway was the name
of the founder of the business but it is really managed by Miss Stoper She sits in her own little office and the ladies who are seeking employment wait in an anteroom and are then shown in one by one when she consults
her ledgers and sees whether she has anything which would suit them
Well when I called last week I was shown into the little office as usual but I found that Miss Stoper was not alone A prodigiously stout man with a very smiling face and a great heavy chin which rolled down in fold upon
fold over his throat sat at her elbow with a pair of glasses on his nose looking very earnestly at the ladies who entered As I came in he gave quite a jump in his chair and turned quickly to Miss Stoper
That will do said he I could not ask for anything better Capital capital He seemed quite enthusiastic and rubbed his hands together in the most genial fashion He was such a comfortable looking man that it was
quite a pleasure to look at him
You are looking for a situation miss he asked
Yes sir As governess
Yes sir PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html And what salary do you ask
I had a month in my last place with Colonel Spence Munro Oh tut tut sweating rank sweating he cried throwing his fat hands out into the air like a man who is in
a boiling passion How could anyone offer so pitiful a sum to a lady with such attractions and accomplishments
My accomplishments sir may be less than you imagine said I A little French a little German music and drawing
Tut tut he cried This is all quite beside the question The point is have you or have you not the bearing and deportment of a lady There it is in a nutshell If you have not you are not fitted for the rearing of a child
who may some day play a considerable part in the history of the country But if you have why then how could any gentleman ask you to condescend to accept anything under the three figures Your salary with me madam
would commence at a year You may imagine Mr Holmes that to me destitute as I was such an offer seemed almost too good to be
true The gentleman however seeing perhaps the look of incredulity upon my face opened a pocket book and took out a note
It is also my custom said he smiling in the most pleasant fashion until his eyes were just two little shining slits amid the white creases of his face to advance to my young ladies half their salary beforehand so that they
may meet any little expenses of their journey and their wardrobe It seemed to me that I had never met so fascinating and so thoughtful a man As I was already in debt to my
tradesmen the advance was a great convenience and yet there was something unnatural about the whole transaction which made me wish to know a little more before I quite committed myself
May I ask where you live sir said I
Hampshire Charming rural place The Copper Beeches five miles on the far side of Winchester It is the most lovely country my dear young lady and the dearest old country house
And my duties sir I should be glad to know what they would be One child one dear little romper just six years old Oh if you could see him killing cockroaches with a
slipper Smack smack smack Three gone before you could wink He leaned back in his chair and laughed his eyes into his head again
I was a little startled at the nature of the child s amusement but the father s laughter made me think that perhaps he was joking
My sole duties then I asked are to take charge of a single child No no not the sole not the sole my dear young lady he cried Your duty would be as I am sure your
good sense would suggest to obey any little commands my wife might give provided always that they were such commands as a lady might with propriety obey You see no difficulty heh
I should be happy to make myself useful Quite so In dress now for example We are faddy people you know faddy but kind hearted If you were
asked to wear any dress which we might give you you would not object to our little whim Heh No said I considerably astonished at his words
Or to sit here or sit there that would not be offensive to you Oh no
Or to cut your hair quite short before you come to us I could hardly believe my ears As you may observe Mr Holmes my hair is somewhat luxuriant and of a
rather peculiar tint of chestnut It has been considered artistic I could not dream of sacrificing it in this offhand fashion
I am afraid that that is quite impossible said I He had been watching me eagerly out of his small eyes and I could see a shadow pass over his face as I spoke
I am afraid that it is quite essential said he It is a little fancy of my wife s and ladies fancies you know madam ladies fancies must be consulted And so you won t cut your hair
No sir I really could not I answered firmly
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
Ah very well then that quite settles the matter It is a pity because in other respects you would really have done very nicely In that case Miss Stoper I had best inspect a few more of your young ladies
The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a word to either of us but she glanced at me now with so much annoyance upon her face that I could not help suspecting that she had lost a handsome
commission through my refusal
Do you desire your name to be kept upon the books she asked
If you please Miss Stoper Well really it seems rather useless since you refuse the most excellent offers in this fashion said she
sharply You can hardly expect us to exert ourselves to find another such opening for you Good day to you Miss Hunter She struck a gong upon the table and I was shown out by the page
Well Mr Holmes when I got back to my lodgings and found little enough in the cupboard and two or three bills upon the table I began to ask myself whether I had not done a very foolish thing After all if these people
had strange fads and expected obedience on the most extraordinary matters they were at least ready to pay for their eccentricity Very few governesses in England are getting a year Besides what use was my hair to
me Many people are improved by wearing it short and perhaps I should be among the number Next day I was inclined to think that I had made a mistake and by the day after I was sure of it I had almost overcome my pride
so far as to go back to the agency and inquire whether the place was still open when I received this letter from the gentleman himself I have it here and I will read it to you
The Copper Beeches near Winchester
DEAR MISS HUNTER Miss Stoper has very kindly given me your address and I write from here to ask you whether you have reconsidered your decision My wife is very
anxious that you should come for she has been much attracted by my description of you
We are willing to give a quarter or a year so as to recompense you for any little inconvenience which our fads may cause you They are not very exacting after all
My wife is fond of a particular shade of electric blue and would like you to wear such a dress indoors in the morning You need not however go to the expense of purchasing one
as we have one belonging to my dear daughter Alice now in Philadelphia which would I should think fit you very well Then as to sitting here or there or amusing yourself in
any manner indicated that need cause you no inconvenience As regards your hair it is no doubt a pity especially as I could not help remarking its beauty during our short interview
but I am afraid that I must remain firm upon this point and I only hope that the increased salary may recompense you for the loss Your duties as far as the child is concerned are
very light Now do try to come and I shall meet you with the dog cart at Winchester Let me know your train Yours faithfully
JEPHRO RUCASTLE That is the letter which I have just received Mr Holmes and my mind is made up that I will accept it I
thought however that before taking the final step I should like to submit the whole matter to your consideration
Well Miss Hunter if your mind is made up that settles the question said Holmes smiling
But you would not advise me to refuse I confess that it is not the situation which I should like to see a sister of mine apply for
What is the meaning of it all Mr Holmes Ah I have no data I cannot tell Perhaps you have yourself formed some opinion
Well there seems to me to be only one possible solution Mr Rucastle seemed to be a very kind good natured man Is it not possible that his wife is a lunatic that he desires to keep the matter quiet for fear she
should be taken to an asylum and that he humours her fancies in every way in order to prevent an outbreak That is a possible solution in fact as matters stand it is the most probable one But in any case it does not
seem to be a nice household for a young lady PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html But the money Mr Holmes the money
Well yes of course the pay is good too good That is what makes me uneasy Why should they give you a year when they could have their pick for There must be some strong reason behind
I thought that if I told you the circumstances you would understand afterwards if I wanted your help I should feel so much stronger if I felt that you were at the back of me
Oh you may carry that feeling away with you I assure you that your little problem promises to be the most interesting which has come my way for some months There is something distinctly novel about some of the
features If you should find yourself in doubt or in danger Danger What danger do you foresee
Holmes shook his head gravely It would cease to be a danger if we could define it said he But at any time day or night a telegram would bring me down to your help
That is enough She rose briskly from her chair with the anxiety all swept from her face I shall go down to Hampshire quite easy in my mind now I shall write to Mr Rucastle at once sacrifice my poor hair to night and
start for Winchester to morrow With a few grateful words to Holmes she bade us both good night and bustled off upon her way
At least said I as we heard her quick firm steps descending the stairs she seems to be a young lady who is very well able to take care of herself
And she would need to be said Holmes gravely I am much mistaken if we do not hear from her before many days are past
It was not very long before my friend s prediction was fulfilled A fortnight went by during which I frequently found my thoughts turning in her direction and wondering what strange side alley of human experience this
lonely woman had strayed into The unusual salary the curious conditions the light duties all pointed to something abnormal though whether a fad or a plot or whether the man were a philanthropist or a villain it was
quite beyond my powers to determine As to Holmes I observed that he sat frequently for half an hour on end with knitted brows and an abstracted air but he swept the matter away with a wave of his hand when I
mentioned it Data data data he cried impatiently I can t make bricks without clay And yet he would always wind up by muttering that no sister of his should ever have accepted such a situation
The telegram which we eventually received came late one night just as I was thinking of turning in and Holmes was settling down to one of those all night chemical researches which he frequently indulged in when I
would leave him stooping over a retort and a test tube at night and find him in the same position when I came down to breakfast in the morning He opened the yellow envelope and then glancing at the message threw it
Just look up the trains in Bradshaw said he and turned back to his chemical studies
The summons was a brief and urgent one
Please be at the Black Swan Hotel at Winchester at midday to morrow it said Do come I am at my wit s end
HUNTER Will you come with me asked Holmes glancing up
I should wish to Just look it up then
There is a train at half past nine said I glancing over my Bradshaw It is due at Winchester at That will do very nicely Then perhaps I had better postpone my analysis of the acetones as we may need to
be at our best in the morning By eleven o clock the next day we were well upon our way to the old English capital Holmes had been buried
in the morning papers all the way down but after we had passed the Hampshire border he threw them down and PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html began to admire the scenery It was an ideal spring day a light blue sky flecked with little fleecy white clouds
drifting across from west to east The sun was shining very brightly and yet there was an exhilarating nip in the air which set an edge to a man s energy All over the countryside away to the rolling hills around Aldershot the
little red and grey roofs of the farm steadings peeped out from amid the light green of the new foliage
Are they not fresh and beautiful I cried with all the enthusiasm of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street
But Holmes shook his head gravely
Do you know Watson said he that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject You look at these scattered houses and you are
impressed by their beauty I look at them and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there
Good heavens I cried Who would associate crime with these dear old homesteads They always fill me with a certain horror It is my belief Watson founded upon my experience that the
lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside
You horrify me But the reason is very obvious The pressure of public opinion can do in the town what the law cannot
accomplish There is no lane so vile that the scream of a tortured child or the thud of a drunkard s blow does not beget sympathy and indignation among the neighbours and then the whole machinery of justice is ever so close
that a word of complaint can set it going and there is but a step between the crime and the dock But look at these lonely houses each in its own fields filled for the most part with poor ignorant folk who know little of the
law Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty the hidden wickedness which may go on year in year out in such places and none the wiser Had this lady who appeals to us for help gone to live in Winchester I should never
have had a fear for her It is the five miles of country which makes the danger Still it is clear that she is not personally threatened
No If she can come to Winchester to meet us she can get away Quite so She has her freedom
What can be the matter then Can you suggest no explanation I have devised seven separate explanations each of which would cover the facts as far as we know them But
which of these is correct can only be determined by the fresh information which we shall no doubt find waiting for us Well there is the tower of the cathedral and we shall soon learn all that Miss Hunter has to tell
The Black Swan is an inn of repute in the High Street at no distance from the station and there we found the young lady waiting for us She had engaged a sitting room and our lunch awaited us upon the table
I am so delighted that you have come she said earnestly It is so very kind of you both but indeed I do not know what I should do Your advice will be altogether invaluable to me
Pray tell us what has happened to you I will do so and I must be quick for I have promised Mr Rucastle to be back before three I got his leave to
come into town this morning though he little knew for what purpose Let us have everything in its due order Holmes thrust his long thin legs out towards the fire and composed
In the first place I may say that I have met on the whole with no actual ill treatment from Mr and Mrs
Rucastle It is only fair to them to say that But I cannot understand them and I am not easy in my mind about them
What can you not understand Their reasons for their conduct But you shall have it all just as it occurred When I came down Mr Rucastle
met me here and drove me in his dog cart to the Copper Beeches It is as he said beautifully situated but it is not beautiful in itself for it is a large square block of a house whitewashed but all stained and streaked with
damp and bad weather There are grounds round it woods on three sides and on the fourth a field which slopes down to the Southampton high road which curves past about a hundred yards from the front door This ground
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
in front belongs to the house but the woods all round are part of Lord Southerton s preserves A clump of copper beeches immediately in front of the hall door has given its name to the place
I was driven over by my employer who was as amiable as ever and was introduced by him that evening to his wife and the child There was no truth Mr Holmes in the conjecture which seemed to us to be probable in
your rooms at Baker Street Mrs Rucastle is not mad I found her to be a silent pale faced woman much younger than her husband not more than thirty I should think while he can hardly be less than forty five From
their conversation I have gathered that they have been married about seven years that he was a widower and that his only child by the first wife was the daughter who has gone to Philadelphia Mr Rucastle told me in
private that the reason why she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her stepmother As the daughter could not have been less than twenty I can quite imagine that her position must have been
uncomfortable with her father s young wife
Mrs Rucastle seemed to me to be colourless in mind as well as in feature She impressed me neither favourably nor the reverse She was a nonentity It was easy to see that she was passionately devoted both to her
husband and to her little son Her light grey eyes wandered continually from one to the other noting every little want and forestalling it if possible He was kind to her also in his bluff boisterous fashion and on the whole they
seemed to be a happy couple And yet she had some secret sorrow this woman She would often be lost in deep thought with the saddest look upon her face More than once I have surprised her in tears I have thought
sometimes that it was the disposition of her child which weighed upon her mind for I have never met so utterly spoiled and so ill natured a little creature He is small for his age with a head which is quite disproportionately
large His whole life appears to be spent in an alternation between savage fits of passion and gloomy intervals of sulking Giving pain to any creature weaker than himself seems to be his one idea of amusement and he shows
quite remarkable talent in planning the capture of mice little birds and insects But I would rather not talk about the creature Mr Holmes and indeed he has little to do with my story
I am glad of all details remarked my friend whether they seem to you to be relevant or not I shall try not to miss anything of importance The one unpleasant thing about the house which struck me at
once was the appearance and conduct of the servants There are only two a man and his wife Toller for that is his name is a rough uncouth man with grizzled hair and whiskers and a perpetual smell of drink Twice since I
have been with them he has been quite drunk and yet Mr Rucastle seemed to take no notice of it His wife is a very tall and strong woman with a sour face as silent as Mrs Rucastle and much less amiable They are a most
unpleasant couple but fortunately I spend most of my time in the nursery and my own room which are next to each other in one corner of the building
For two days after my arrival at the Copper Beeches my life was very quiet on the third Mrs Rucastle came down just after breakfast and whispered something to her husband
Oh yes said he turning to me we are very much obliged to you Miss Hunter for falling in with our whims so far as to cut your hair I assure you that it has not detracted in the tiniest iota from your appearance We
shall now see how the electric blue dress will become you You will find it laid out upon the bed in your room and if you would be so good as to put it on we should both be extremely obliged
The dress which I found waiting for me was of a peculiar shade of blue It was of excellent material a sort of beige but it bore unmistakable signs of having been worn before It could not have been a better fit if I had been
measured for it Both Mr and Mrs Rucastle expressed a delight at the look of it which seemed quite exaggerated in its vehemence They were waiting for me in the drawing room which is a very large room
stretching along the entire front of the house with three long windows reaching down to the floor A chair had been placed close to the central window with its back turned towards it In this I was asked to sit and then Mr
Rucastle walking up and down on the other side of the room began to tell me a series of the funniest stories that I have ever listened to You cannot imagine how comical he was and I laughed until I was quite weary Mrs
Rucastle however who has evidently no sense of humour never so much as smiled but sat with her hands in her lap and a sad anxious look upon her face After an hour or so Mr Rucastle suddenly remarked that it was
time to commence the duties of the day and that I might change my dress and go to little Edward in the nursery
Two days later this same performance was gone through under exactly similar circumstances Again I changed my dress again I sat in the window and again I laughed very heartily at the funny stories of which my
employer had an immense r pertoire and which he told inimitably Then he handed me a yellow backed novel and moving my chair a little sideways that my own shadow might not fall upon the page he begged me to read
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
aloud to him I read for about ten minutes beginning in the heart of a chapter and then suddenly in the middle of a sentence he ordered me to cease and to change my dress
You can easily imagine Mr Holmes how curious I became as to what the meaning of this extraordinary performance could possibly be They were always very careful I observed to turn my face away from the
window so that I became consumed with the desire to see what was going on behind my back At first it seemed to be impossible but I soon devised a means My hand mirror had been broken so a happy thought seized me
and I concealed a piece of the glass in my handkerchief On the next occasion in the midst of my laughter I put my handkerchief up to my eyes and was able with a little management to see all that there was behind me I
confess that I was disappointed There was nothing At least that was my first impression At the second glance however I perceived that there was a man standing in the Southampton Road a small bearded man in a grey
suit who seemed to be looking in my direction The road is an important highway and there are usually people there This man however was leaning against the railings which bordered our field and was looking earnestly
up I lowered my handkerchief and glanced at Mrs Rucastle to find her eyes fixed upon me with a most searching gaze She said nothing but I am convinced that she had divined that I had a mirror in my hand and had
seen what was behind me She rose at once
Jephro said she there is an impertinent fellow upon the road there who stares up at Miss Hunter No friend of yours Miss Hunter he asked
No I know no one in these parts Dear me How very impertinent Kindly turn round and motion to him to go away
Surely it would be better to take no notice No no we should have him loitering here always Kindly turn round and wave him away like that
I did as I was told and at the same instant Mrs Rucastle drew down the blind That was a week ago and from that time I have not sat again in the window nor have I worn the blue dress nor seen the man in the road
Pray continue said Holmes Your narrative promises to be a most interesting one You will find it rather disconnected I fear and there may prove to be little relation between the different
incidents of which I speak On the very first day that I was at the Copper Beeches Mr Rucastle took me to a small outhouse which stands near the kitchen door As we approached it I heard the sharp rattling of a chain and
the sound as of a large animal moving about
Look in here said Mr Rucastle showing me a slit between two planks Is he not a beauty I looked through and was conscious of two glowing eyes and of a vague figure huddled up in the darkness
Don t be frightened said my employer laughing at the start which I had given It s only Carlo my mastiff
I call him mine but really old Toller my groom is the only man who can do anything with him We feed him once a day and not too much then so that he is always as keen as mustard Toller lets him loose every night and
God help the trespasser whom he lays his fangs upon For goodness sake don t you ever on any pretext set your foot over the threshold at night for it s as much as your life is worth
The warning was no idle one for two nights later I happened to look out of my bedroom window about two o clock in the morning It was a beautiful moonlight night and the lawn in front of the house was silvered over
and almost as bright as day I was standing rapt in the peaceful beauty of the scene when I was aware that something was moving under the shadow of the copper beeches As it emerged into the moonshine I saw what it
was It was a giant dog as large as a calf tawny tinted with hanging jowl black muzzle and huge projecting bones It walked slowly across the lawn and vanished into the shadow upon the other side That dreadful sentinel
sent a chill to my heart which I do not think that any burglar could have done
And now I have a very strange experience to tell you I had as you know cut off my hair in London and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk One evening after the child was in bed I began to amuse
myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things There was an old chest of drawers in the room the two upper ones empty and open the lower one locked I had filled the first two with
my linen and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer
It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it The very first key fitted to perfection and I drew the drawer open There was only one thing in it but I
am sure that you would never guess what it was It was my coil of hair
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
I took it up and examined it It was of the same peculiar tint and the same thickness But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me How could my hair have been locked in the drawer With
trembling hands I undid my trunk turned out the contents and drew from the bottom my own hair I laid the two tresses together and I assure you that they were identical Was it not extraordinary Puzzle as I would I could
make nothing at all of what it meant I returned the strange hair to the drawer and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked
I am naturally observant as you may have remarked Mr Holmes and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head There was one wing however which appeared not to be inhabited at all A door which
faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite but it was invariably locked One day however as I ascended the stair I met Mr Rucastle coming out through this door his keys in his hand and a
look on his face which made him a very different person to the round jovial man to whom I was accustomed
His cheeks were red his brow was all crinkled with anger and the veins stood out at his temples with passion
He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look
This aroused my curiosity so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house There were four of them in a row three of
which were simply dirty while the fourth was shuttered up They were evidently all deserted As I strolled up and down glancing at them occasionally Mr Rucastle came out to me looking as merry and jovial as ever
Ah said he you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word my dear young lady I was preoccupied with business matters
I assured him that I was not offended By the way said I you seem to have quite a suite of spare rooms up there and one of them has the shutters up
He looked surprised and as it seemed to me a little startled at my remark
Photography is one of my hobbies said he I have made my dark room up there But dear me what an observant young lady we have come upon Who would have believed it Who would have ever believed it He
spoke in a jesting tone but there was no jest in his eyes as he looked at me I read suspicion there and annoyance but no jest
Well Mr Holmes from the moment that I understood that there was something about that suite of rooms which I was not to know I was all on fire to go over them It was not mere curiosity though I have my share of
that It was more a feeling of duty a feeling that some good might come from my penetrating to this place
They talk of woman s instinct perhaps it was woman s instinct which gave me that feeling At any rate it was there and I was keenly on the lookout for any chance to pass the forbidden door
It was only yesterday that the chance came I may tell you that besides Mr Rucastle both Toller and his wife find something to do in these deserted rooms and I once saw him carrying a large black linen bag with him
through the door Recently he has been drinking hard and yesterday evening he was very drunk and when I came upstairs there was the key in the door I have no doubt at all that he had left it there Mr and Mrs Rucastle
were both downstairs and the child was with them so that I had an admirable opportunity I turned the key gently in the lock opened the door and slipped through
There was a little passage in front of me unpapered and uncarpeted which turned at a right angle at the farther end Round this corner were three doors in a line the first and third of which were open They each led
into an empty room dusty and cheerless with two windows in the one and one in the other so thick with dirt that the evening light glimmered dimly through them The centre door was closed and across the outside of it
had been fastened one of the broad bars of an iron bed padlocked at one end to a ring in the wall and fastened at the other with stout cord The door itself was locked as well and the key was not there This barricaded door
corresponded clearly with the shuttered window outside and yet I could see by the glimmer from beneath it that the room was not in darkness Evidently there was a skylight which let in light from above As I stood in the
passage gazing at the sinister door and wondering what secret it might veil I suddenly heard the sound of steps within the room and saw a shadow pass backward and forward against the little slit of dim light which shone out
from under the door A mad unreasoning terror rose up in me at the sight Mr Holmes My overstrung nerves failed me suddenly and I turned and ran ran as though some dreadful hand were behind me clutching at the
skirt of my dress I rushed down the passage through the door and straight into the arms of Mr Rucastle who was waiting outside
So said he smiling it was you then I thought that it must be when I saw the door open PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html Oh I am so frightened I panted
My dear young lady my dear young lady you cannot think how caressing and soothing his manner was and what has frightened you my dear young lady
But his voice was just a little too coaxing He overdid it I was keenly on my guard against him
I was foolish enough to go into the empty wing I answered But it is so lonely and eerie in this dim light that I was frightened and ran out again Oh it is so dreadfully still in there
Only that said he looking at me keenly
Why what did you think I asked
Why do you think that I lock this door I am sure that I do not know
It is to keep people out who have no business there Do you see He was still smiling in the most amiable manner
I am sure if I had known Well then you know now And if you ever put your foot over that threshold again here in an instant the
smile hardened into a grin of rage and he glared down at me with the face of a demon I ll throw you to the mastiff
I was so terrified that I do not know what I did I suppose that I must have rushed past him into my room I remember nothing until I found myself lying on my bed trembling all over Then I thought of you Mr Holmes I
could not live there longer without some advice I was frightened of the house of the man of the woman of the servants even of the child They were all horrible to me If I could only bring you down all would be well Of
course I might have fled from the house but my curiosity was almost as strong as my fears My mind was soon made up I would send you a wire I put on my hat and cloak went down to the office which is about half a mile
from the house and then returned feeling very much easier A horrible doubt came into my mind as I approached the door lest the dog might be loose but I remembered that Toller had drunk himself into a state of
insensibility that evening and I knew that he was the only one in the household who had any influence with the savage creature or who would venture to set him free I slipped in in safety and lay awake half the night in my
joy at the thought of seeing you I had no difficulty in getting leave to come into Winchester this morning but I must be back before three o clock for Mr and Mrs Rucastle are going on a visit and will be away all the
evening so that I must look after the child Now I have told you all my adventures Mr Holmes and I should be very glad if you could tell me what it all means and above all what I should do
Holmes and I had listened spellbound to this extraordinary story My friend rose now and paced up and down the room his hands in his pockets and an expression of the most profound gravity upon his face
Is Toller still drunk he asked
Yes I heard his wife tell Mrs Rucastle that she could do nothing with him That is well And the Rucastles go out to night
Yes Is there a cellar with a good strong lock
Yes the wine cellar You seem to me to have acted all through this matter like a very brave and sensible girl Miss Hunter Do you
think that you could perform one more feat I should not ask it of you if I did not think you a quite exceptional woman
I will try What is it We shall be at the Copper Beeches by seven o clock my friend and I The Rucastles will be gone by that
time and Toller will we hope be incapable There only remains Mrs Toller who might give the alarm If you could send her into the cellar on some errand and then turn the key upon her you would facilitate matters
immensely I will do it
Excellent We shall then look thoroughly into the affair Of course there is only one feasible explanation You have been brought there to personate someone and the real person is imprisoned in this chamber That is
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
obvious As to who this prisoner is I have no doubt that it is the daughter Miss Alice Rucastle if I remember right who was said to have gone to America You were chosen doubtless as resembling her in height figure
and the colour of your hair Hers had been cut off very possibly in some illness through which she has passed and so of course yours had to be sacrificed also By a curious chance you came upon her tresses The man in the
road was undoubtedly some friend of hers possibly her fianc and no doubt as you wore the girl s dress and were so like her he was convinced from your laughter whenever he saw you and afterwards from your gesture
that Miss Rucastle was perfectly happy and that she no longer desired his attentions The dog is let loose at night to prevent him from endeavouring to communicate with her So much is fairly clear The most serious point in
the case is the disposition of the child What on earth has that to do with it I ejaculated
My dear Watson you as a medical man are continually gaining light as to the tendencies of a child by the study of the parents Don t you see that the converse is equally valid I have frequently gained my first real
insight into the character of parents by studying their children This child s disposition is abnormally cruel merely for cruelty s sake and whether he derives this from his smiling father as I should suspect or from his
mother it bodes evil for the poor girl who is in their power I am sure that you are right Mr Holmes cried our client A thousand things come back to me which make
me certain that you have hit it Oh let us lose not an instant in bringing help to this poor creature We must be circumspect for we are dealing with a very cunning man We can do nothing until seven o clock
At that hour we shall be with you and it will not be long before we solve the mystery We were as good as our word for it was just seven when we reached the Copper Beeches having put up our
trap at a wayside public house The group of trees with their dark leaves shining like burnished metal in the light of the setting sun were sufficient to mark the house even had Miss Hunter not been standing smiling on the
Have you managed it asked Holmes
A loud thudding noise came from somewhere downstairs That is Mrs Toller in the cellar said she Her husband lies snoring on the kitchen rug Here are his keys which are the duplicates of Mr Rucastle s
You have done well indeed cried Holmes with enthusiasm Now lead the way and we shall soon see the end of this black business
We passed up the stair unlocked the door followed on down a passage and found ourselves in front of the barricade which Miss Hunter had described Holmes cut the cord and removed the transverse bar Then he tried
the various keys in the lock but without success No sound came from within and at the silence Holmes face clouded over
I trust that we are not too late said he I think Miss Hunter that we had better go in without you Now Watson put your shoulder to it and we shall see whether we cannot make our way in
It was an old rickety door and gave at once before our united strength Together we rushed into the room It was empty There was no furniture save a little pallet bed a small table and a basketful of linen The skylight
above was open and the prisoner gone
There has been some villainy here said Holmes this beauty has guessed Miss Hunter s intentions and has carried his victim off
But how Through the skylight We shall soon see how he managed it He swung himself up onto the roof Ah yes
he cried here s the end of a long light ladder against the eaves That is how he did it But it is impossible said Miss Hunter the ladder was not there when the Rucastles went away
He has come back and done it I tell you that he is a clever and dangerous man I should not be very much surprised if this were he whose step I hear now upon the stair I think Watson that it would be as well for you to
have your pistol ready The words were hardly out of his mouth before a man appeared at the door of the room a very fat and burly
man with a heavy stick in his hand Miss Hunter screamed and shrunk against the wall at the sight of him but Sherlock Holmes sprang forward and confronted him
You villain said he where s your daughter PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg
https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html The fat man cast his eyes round and then up at the open skylight
It is for me to ask you that he shrieked you thieves Spies and thieves I have caught you have I You are in my power I ll serve you He turned and clattered down the stairs as hard as he could go
He s gone for the dog cried Miss Hunter
I have my revolver said I
Better close the front door cried Holmes and we all rushed down the stairs together We had hardly reached the hall when we heard the baying of a hound and then a scream of agony with a horrible worrying sound which
it was dreadful to listen to An elderly man with a red face and shaking limbs came staggering out at a side door
My God he cried Someone has loosed the dog It s not been fed for two days Quick quick or it ll be too late
Holmes and I rushed out and round the angle of the house with Toller hurrying behind us There was the huge famished brute its black muzzle buried in Rucastle s throat while he writhed and screamed upon the ground
Running up I blew its brains out and it fell over with its keen white teeth still meeting in the great creases of his neck With much labour we separated them and carried him living but horribly mangled into the house We laid
him upon the drawing room sofa and having dispatched the sobered Toller to bear the news to his wife I did what I could to relieve his pain We were all assembled round him when the door opened and a tall gaunt
woman entered the room
Mrs Toller cried Miss Hunter
Yes miss Mr Rucastle let me out when he came back before he went up to you Ah miss it is a pity you didn t let me know what you were planning for I would have told you that your pains were wasted
Ha said Holmes looking keenly at her It is clear that Mrs Toller knows more about this matter than anyone else
Yes sir I do and I am ready enough to tell what I know Then pray sit down and let us hear it for there are several points on which I must confess that I am still in
the dark I will soon make it clear to you said she and I d have done so before now if I could ha got out from the
cellar If there s police court business over this you ll remember that I was the one that stood your friend and that I was Miss Alice s friend too
She was never happy at home Miss Alice wasn t from the time that her father married again She was slighted like and had no say in anything but it never really became bad for her until after she met Mr Fowler at
a friend s house As well as I could learn Miss Alice had rights of her own by will but she was so quiet and patient she was that she never said a word about them but just left everything in Mr Rucastle s hands He knew
he was safe with her but when there was a chance of a husband coming forward who would ask for all that the law would give him then her father thought it time to put a stop on it He wanted her to sign a paper so that
whether she married or not he could use her money When she wouldn t do it he kept on worrying her until she got brain fever and for six weeks was at death s door Then she got better at last all worn to a shadow and with
her beautiful hair cut off but that didn t make no change in her young man and he stuck to her as true as man could be
Ah said Holmes I think that what you have been good enough to tell us makes the matter fairly clear and that I can deduce all that remains Mr Rucastle then I presume took to this system of imprisonment
Yes sir And brought Miss Hunter down from London in order to get rid of the disagreeable persistence of Mr
Fowler That was it sir
But Mr Fowler being a persevering man as a good seaman should be blockaded the house and having met you succeeded by certain arguments metallic or otherwise in convincing you that your interests were the same
as his Mr Fowler was a very kind spoken free handed gentleman said Mrs Toller serenely
And in this way he managed that your good man should have no want of drink and that a ladder should be ready at the moment when your master had gone out
PM The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes Project Gutenberg https www gutenberg org cache epub pg images html
You have it sir just as it happened I am sure we owe you an apology Mrs Toller said Holmes for you have certainly cleared up everything
which puzzled us And here comes the country surgeon and Mrs Rucastle so I think Watson that we had best escort Miss Hunter back to Winchester as it seems to me that our locus standi now is rather a questionable one
And thus was solved the mystery of the sinister house with the copper beeches in front of the door Mr
Rucastle survived but was always a broken man kept alive solely through the care of his devoted wife They still live with their old servants who probably know so much of Rucastle s past life that he finds it difficult to
part from them Mr Fowler and Miss Rucastle were married by special license in Southampton the day after their flight and he is now the holder of a government appointment in the island of Mauritius As to Miss Violet
Hunter my friend Holmes rather to my disappointment manifested no further interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one of his problems and she is now the head of a private school at Walsall where I
believe that she has met with considerable success
